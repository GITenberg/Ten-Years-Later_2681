        Transcriber's Notes:
      </h3>
      <p>
        As you may be aware, Project Gutenberg has been involved with the
        writings of both the Alexandre Dumases for some time now, and since we
        get a few questions about the order in which the books should be read,
        and in which they were published, these following comments should
        hopefully help most of our readers.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The Vicomte de Bragelonne is the final volume of D'Artagnan Romances: it
        is usually split into three or four parts, and the final portion is
        entitled The Man in the Iron Mask. The Man in the Iron Mask we're
        familiar with today is the last volume of the four-volume edition. [Not
        all the editions split them in the same manner, hence some of the
        confusion...but wait...there's yet more reason for confusion.]
      </p>
      <p>
        We intend to do ALL of The Vicomte de Bragelonne, split into four etexts
        entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later, Louise de la
        Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask; you WILL be getting The Man in
        the Iron Mask.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing that may be causing confusion is that the etext we have now,
        entitled Ten Years Later, says it's the sequel to The Three Musketeers.
        While this is technically true, there's another book, Twenty Years
        After, that comes between. The confusion is generated by the two facts
        that we published Ten Years Later BEFORE we published Twenty Years
        After, and that many people see those titles as meaning Ten and Twenty
        Years "After" the original story...however, this is why the different
        words "After" and "Later"...the Ten Years "After" is ten years after the
        Twenty Years later...as per history. Also, the third book of the
        D'Artagnan Romances, while entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne, has the
        subtitle Ten Years Later. These two titles are also given to different
        volumes: The Vicomte de Bragelonne can refer to the whole book, or the
        first volume of the three or four-volume editions. Ten Years Later can,
        similarly, refer to the whole book, or the second volume of the
        four-volume edition. To add to the confusion, in the case of our etexts,
        it refers to the first 104 chapters of the whole book, covering material
        in the first and second etexts in the new series. Here is a guide to the

      <h2>
        Introduction:
      </h2>
      <p>
        In the months of March-July in 1844, in the magazine Le Siecle, the
        first portion of a story appeared, penned by the celebrated playwright
        Alexandre Dumas. It was based, he claimed, on some manuscripts he had
        found a year earlier in the Bibliotheque Nationale while researching a
        history he planned to write on Louis XIV. They chronicled the adventures
        of a young man named D'Artagnan who, upon entering Paris, became almost
        immediately embroiled in court intrigues, international politics, and
        ill-fated affairs between royal lovers. Over the next six years, readers
        would enjoy the adventures of this youth and his three famous friends,
        Porthos, Athos, and Aramis, as their exploits unraveled behind the
        scenes of some of the most momentous events in French and even English
        history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually these serialized adventures were published in novel form, and
        became the three D'Artagnan Romances known today. Here is a brief
        summary of the first two novels:
      </p>
      <p>
        The Three Musketeers (serialized March-July, 1844): The year is 1625.
        The young D'Artagnan arrives in Paris at the tender age of 18, and
        almost immediately offends three musketeers, Porthos, Aramis, and Athos.
        Instead of dueling, the four are attacked by five of the Cardinal's
        guards, and the courage of the youth is made apparent during the battle.
        The four become fast friends, and, when asked by D'Artagnan's landlord
        to find his missing wife, embark upon an adventure that takes them
        across both France and England in order to thwart the plans of the
        Cardinal Richelieu. Along the way, they encounter a beautiful young spy,
        named simply Milady, who will stop at nothing to disgrace Queen Anne of
        Austria before her husband, Louis XIII, and take her revenge upon the
        four friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Twenty Years After (serialized January-August, 1845): The year is now
        1648, twenty years since the close of the last story. Louis XIII has
        died, as has Cardinal Richelieu, and while the crown of France may sit
        upon the head of Anne of Austria as Regent for the young Louis XIV, the
        real power resides with the Cardinal Mazarin, her secret husband.
        D'Artagnan is now a lieutenant of musketeers, and his three friends have
        retired to private life. Athos turned out to be a nobleman, the Comte de
        la Fere, and has retired to his home with his son, Raoul de Bragelonne.
        Aramis, whose real name is D'Herblay, has followed his intention of
        shedding the musketeer's cassock for the priest's robes, and Porthos has
        married a wealthy woman, who left him her fortune upon her death. But
        trouble is stirring in both France and England. Cromwell menaces the
        institution of royalty itself while marching against Charles I, and at
        home the Fronde is threatening to tear France apart. D'Artagnan brings
        his friends out of retirement to save the threatened English monarch,
        but Mordaunt, the son of Milady, who seeks to avenge his mother's death
        at the musketeers' hands, thwarts their valiant efforts. Undaunted, our
        heroes return to France just in time to help save the young Louis XIV,
        quiet the Fronde, and tweak the nose of Cardinal Mazarin.
      </p>
      <p>
        The third novel, The Vicomte de Bragelonne (serialized October, 1847
        &mdash;January, 1850), has enjoyed a strange history in its English
        translation. It has been split into three, four, or five volumes at
        various points in its history. The five-volume edition generally does
        not give titles to the smaller portions, but the others do. In the
        three-volume edition, the novels are entitled The Vicomte de Bragelonne,
        Louise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. For the purposes of
        this etext, I have chosen to split the novel as the four-volume edition
        does, with these titles: The Vicomte de Bragelonne, Ten Years Later,
        Louise de la Valliere, and The Man in the Iron Mask. In the last etext:
      </p>
      <p>
        The Vicomte de Bragelonne (Etext 2609): It is the year 1660, and
        D'Artagnan, after thirty-five years of loyal service, has become
        disgusted with serving King Louis XIV while the real power resides with
        the Cardinal Mazarin, and has tendered his resignation. He embarks on
        his own project, that of restoring Charles II to the throne of England,
        and, with the help of Athos, succeeds, earning himself quite a fortune
        in the process. D'Artagnan returns to Paris to live the life of a rich
        citizen, and Athos, after negotiating the marriage of Philip, the king's
        brother, to Princess Henrietta of England, likewise retires to his own
        estate, La Fere. Meanwhile, Mazarin has finally died, and left Louis to
        assume the reigns of power, with the assistance of M. Colbert, formerly
        Mazarin's trusted clerk. Colbert has an intense hatred for M. Fouquet,
        the king's superintendent of finances, and has resolved to use any means
        necessary to bring about his fall. With the new rank of intendant
        bestowed on him by Louis, Colbert succeeds in having two of Fouquet's
        loyal friends tried and executed. He then brings to the king's attention
        that Fouquet is fortifying the island of Belle-Ile-en-Mer, and could
        possibly be planning to use it as a base for some military operation
        against the king. Louis calls D'Artagnan out of retirement and sends him
        to investigate the island, promising him a tremendous salary and his
        long-promised promotion to captain of the musketeers upon his return. At
        Belle-Isle, D'Artagnan discovers that the engineer of the fortifications
        is, in fact, Porthos, now the Baron du Vallon, and that's not all. The
        blueprints for the island, although in Porthos's handwriting, show
        evidence of another script that has been erased, that of Aramis.
        D'Artagnan later discovers that Aramis has become the bishop of Vannes,
        which is, coincidentally, a parish belonging to M. Fouquet. Suspecting
        that D'Artagnan has arrived on the king's behalf to investigate, Aramis
        tricks D'Artagnan into wandering around Vannes in search of Porthos, and
        sends Porthos on an heroic ride back to Paris to warn Fouquet of the
        danger. Fouquet rushes to the king, and gives him Belle-Isle as a
        present, thus allaying any suspicion, and at the same time humiliating
        Colbert, just minutes before the usher announces someone else seeking an
        audience with the king.

        There is one French custom that may cause confusion. The Duc d'Orleans
        is traditionally called "Monsieur" and his wife "Madame." Gaston, the
        king's uncle, currently holds that title. Upon the event of his death,
        it will be conferred upon the king's brother, Philip, who is currently
        the Duc d'Anjou. The customary title of "Monsieur" will go to him as
        well, and upon his future wife, Henrietta of England, that of "Madame."
        Gaston's widow will be referred to as the "Dowager Madame."&mdash;JB

    <h2>
      Chapter I. In which D'Artagnan finishes by at Length placing his Hand upon
      his Captain's Commission.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The reader guesses beforehand whom the usher preceded in announcing the
      courier from Bretagne. This messenger was easily recognized. It was
      D'Artagnan, his clothes dusty, his face inflamed, his hair dripping with
      sweat, his legs stiff; he lifted his feet painfully at every step, on
      which resounded the clink of his blood-stained spurs. He perceived in the
      doorway he was passing through, the superintendent coming out. Fouquet
      bowed with a smile to him who, an hour before, was bringing him ruin and
      death. D'Artagnan found in his goodness of heart, and in his inexhaustible
      vigor of body, enough presence of mind to remember the kind reception of
      this man; he bowed then, also, much more from benevolence and compassion,
      than from respect. He felt upon his lips the word which had so many times
      been repeated to the Duc de Guise: "Fly." But to pronounce that word would
      have been to betray his cause; to speak that word in the cabinet of the
      king, and before an usher, would have been to ruin himself gratuitously,
      and could save nobody. D'Artagnan then, contented himself with bowing to
      Fouquet and entered. At this moment the king floated between the joy the
      last words of Fouquet had given him, and his pleasure at the return of
      D'Artagnan. Without being a courtier, D'Artagnan had a glance as sure and
      as rapid as if he had been one. He read, on his entrance, devouring
      humiliation on the countenance of Colbert. He even heard the king say
      these words to him:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Monsieur Colbert; you have then nine hundred thousand livres at the
      intendance?" Colbert, suffocated, bowed but made no reply. All this scene
      entered into the mind of D'Artagnan, by the eyes and ears, at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first word of Louis to his musketeer, as if he wished it to contrast
      with what he was saying at the moment, was a kind "good day." His second
      was to send away Colbert. The latter left the king's cabinet, pallid and
      tottering, whilst D'Artagnan twisted up the ends of his mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love to see one of my servants in this disorder," said the king,
      admiring the martial stains upon the clothes of his envoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought, sire, my presence at the Louvre was sufficiently urgent to
      excuse my presenting myself thus before you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bring me great news, then, monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, the thing is this, in two words: Belle-Isle is fortified, admirably
      fortified; Belle-Isle has a double <i>enceinte</i>, a citadel, two
      detached forts; its ports contain three corsairs; and the side batteries
      only await their cannon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know all that, monsieur," replied the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! your majesty knows all that?" replied the musketeer, stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have the plan of the fortifications of Belle-Isle," said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty has the plan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is really correct, sire: I saw a similar one on the spot."
    </p>
    <p>
      D'Artagnan's brow became clouded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! I understand all. Your majesty did not trust to me alone, but sent
      some other person," said he in a reproachful tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of what importance is the manner, monsieur, in which I have learnt what I
      know, so that I know it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, sire," said the musketeer, without seeking even to conceal his
      dissatisfaction; "but I must be permitted to say to your majesty, that it
      is not worth while to make me use such speed, to risk twenty times the
      breaking of my neck, to salute me on my arrival with such intelligence.
      Sire, when people are not trusted, or are deemed insufficient, they should
      scarcely be employed." And D'Artagnan, with a movement perfectly military,
      stamped with his foot, and left upon the floor dust stained with blood.
      The king looked at him, inwardly enjoying his first triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," said he, at the expiration of a minute, "not only is
      Belle-Isle known to me, but, still further, Belle-Isle is mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is well! that is well, sire, I ask but one thing more," replied
      D'Artagnan.&mdash;"My discharge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! your discharge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without doubt I am too proud to eat the bread of the king without earning
      it, or rather by gaining it badly.&mdash;My discharge, sire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, oh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ask for my discharge, or I will take it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are angry, monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have reason, <i>mordioux!</i> Thirty-two hours in the saddle, I ride
      day and night, I perform prodigies of speed, I arrive stiff as the corpse
      of a man who has been hung&mdash;and another arrives before me! Come,
      sire, I am a fool!&mdash;My discharge, sire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur d'Artagnan," said Louis, leaning his white hand upon the dusty
      arm of the musketeer, "what I tell you will not at all affect that which I
      promised you. A king's word given must be kept." And the king going
      straight to his table, opened a drawer, and took out a folded paper. "Here
      is your commission of captain of musketeers; you have won it, Monsieur
      d'Artagnan."
    </p>
    <p>
      D'Artagnan opened the paper eagerly, and scanned it twice. He could
      scarcely believe his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this commission is given you," continued the king, "not only on
      account of your journey to Belle-Isle but, moreover, for your brave
      intervention at the Place de Greve. There, likewise, you served me
      valiantly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, ah!" said D'Artagnan, without his self-command being able to prevent
      a blush from mounting to his eyes&mdash;"you know that also, sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king possessed a piercing glance and an infallible judgment when it
      was his object to read men's minds. "You have something to say," said he
      to the musketeer, "something to say which you do not say. Come, speak
      freely, monsieur; you know that I told you, once and for all, that you are
      to be always quite frank with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sire! what I have to say is this, that I would prefer being made
      captain of the musketeers for having charged a battery at the head of my
      company, or taken a city, than for causing two wretches to be hung."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this quite true you tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why should your majesty suspect me of dissimulation, I ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I have known you well, monsieur; you cannot repent of having
      drawn your sword for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, in that your majesty is deceived, and greatly; yes, I do repent of
      having drawn my sword on account of the results that action produced; the
      poor men who were hung, sire, were neither your enemies nor mine; and they
      could not defend themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king preserved silence for a moment. "And your companion, M.
      d'Artagnan, does he partake of your repentance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My companion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you were not alone, I have been told."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alone, where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the Place de Greve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sire, no," said D'Artagnan, blushing at the idea that the king might
      have a suspicion that he, D'Artagnan, had wished to engross to himself all
      the glory that belonged to Raoul; "no, <i>mordioux!</i> and as your
      majesty says, I had a companion, and a good companion, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A young man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire; a young man. Oh! your majesty must accept my compliments, you
      are as well informed of things out of doors as things within. It is M.
      Colbert who makes all these fine reports to the king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. Colbert has said nothing but good of you, M. d'Artagnan, and he would
      have met with a bad reception if he had come to tell me anything else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is fortunate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he also said much good of that young man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And with justice," said the musketeer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In short, it appears that this young man is a fire-eater," said Louis, in
      order to sharpen the sentiment which he mistook for envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fire-eater! Yes, sire," repeated D'Artagnan, delighted on his part to
      direct the king's attention to Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not know his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I think&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know him then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have known him nearly five-and-twenty years, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, he is scarcely twenty-five years old!" cried the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sire! I have known him ever since he was born, that is all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you affirm that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire," said D'Artagnan, "your majesty questions me with a mistrust in
      which I recognize another character than your own. M. Colbert, who has so
      well informed you, has he not forgotten to tell you that this young man is
      the son of my most intimate friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Vicomte de Bragelonne?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, sire. The father of the Vicomte de Bragelonne is M. le Comte
      de la Fere, who so powerfully assisted in the restoration of King Charles
      II. Bragelonne comes of a valiant race, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then he is the son of that nobleman who came to me, or rather to M.
      Mazarin, on the part of King Charles II., to offer me his alliance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the Comte de la Fere is a great soldier, say you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, he is a man who has drawn his sword more times for the king, your
      father, than there are, at present, months in the happy life of your
      majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Louis XIV. who now bit his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is well, M. d'Artagnan, very well! And M. le Comte de la Fere is
      your friend, say you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For about forty years; yes, sire. Your majesty may see that I do not
      speak to you of yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Should you be glad to see this young man, M. d'Artagnan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Delighted, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king touched his bell, and an usher appeared. "Call M. de Bragelonne,"
      said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! ah! he is here?" said D'Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is on guard to-day, at the Louvre, with the company of the gentlemen
      of monsieur le prince."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king had scarcely ceased speaking, when Raoul presented himself, and,
      on seeing D'Artagnan, smiled on him with that charming smile which is only
      found upon the lips of youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come," said D'Artagnan, familiarly, to Raoul, "the king will allow
      you to embrace me; only tell his majesty you thank him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul bowed so gracefully, that Louis, to whom all superior qualities were
      pleasing when they did not overshadow his own, admired his beauty,
      strength, and modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," said the king, addressing Raoul, "I have asked monsieur le
      prince to be kind enough to give you up to me; I have received his reply,
      and you belong to me from this morning. Monsieur le prince was a good
      master, but I hope you will not lose by the exchange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, Raoul, be satisfied; the king has some good in him," said
      D'Artagnan, who had fathomed the character of Louis, and who played with
      his self-love, within certain limits; always observing, be it understood,
      the proprieties and flattering, even when he appeared to be bantering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire," said Bragelonne, with voice soft and musical, and with the natural
      and easy elocution he inherited from his father; "Sire, it is not from
      to-day that I belong to your majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! no, I know," said the king, "you mean your enterprise of the Greve.
      That day, you were truly mine, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, it is not of that day I would speak; it would not become me to
      refer to so paltry a service in the presence of such a man as M.
      d'Artagnan. I would speak of a circumstance which created an epoch in my
      life, and which consecrated me, from the age of sixteen, to the devoted
      service of your majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! ah!" said the king, "what was that circumstance? Tell me, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is it, sire.&mdash;When I was setting out on my first campaign, that
      is to say, to join the army of monsieur le prince, M. le Comte de la Fere
      came to conduct me as far as Saint-Denis, where the remains of King Louis
      XIII. wait, upon the lowest steps of the funeral <i>basilique</i>, a
      successor, whom God will not send him, I hope, for many years. Then he
      made me swear upon the ashes of our masters, to serve royalty, represented
      by you&mdash;incarnate in you, sire&mdash;to serve it in word, in thought,
      and in action. I swore, and God and the dead were witnesses to my oath.
      During ten years, sire, I have not so often as I desired had occasion to
      keep it. I am a soldier of your majesty, and nothing else; and, on calling
      me nearer to you, I do not change my master, I only change my garrison."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul was silent and bowed. Louis still listened after he had done
      speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Mordioux!</i>" cried D'Artagnan, "that was well spoken! was it not,
      your majesty? A good race! a noble race!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," murmured the king, without, however daring to manifest his emotion,
      for it had no other cause than contact with a nature intrinsically noble.
      "Yes, monsieur, you say truly:&mdash;wherever you were, you were the
      king's. But in changing your garrison, believe me you will find an
      advancement of which you are worthy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul saw that this ended what the king had to say to him. And with the
      perfect tact which characterized his refined nature, he bowed and retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there anything else, monsieur, of which you have to inform me?" said
      the king, when he found himself again alone with D'Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire, and I kept that news for the last, for it is sad, and will
      clothe European royalty in mourning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, in passing through Blois, a word, a sad word, echoed from the
      palace, struck my ear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In truth, you terrify me, M. d'Artagnan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, this word was pronounced to me by a <i>piqueur</i>, who wore crape
      on his arm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My uncle, Gaston of Orleans, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, he has rendered his last sigh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I was not warned of it!" cried the king, whose royal susceptibility
      saw an insult in the absence of this intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! do not be angry, sire," said D'Artagnan; "neither the couriers of
      Paris, nor the couriers of the whole world, can travel with your servant;
      the courier from Blois will not be here these two hours, and he rides
      well, I assure you, seeing that I only passed him on the thither side of
      Orleans."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My uncle Gaston," murmured Louis, pressing his hand to his brow, and
      comprising in those three words all that his memory recalled of that
      symbol of opposing sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh! yes, sire, it is thus," said D'Artagnan, philosophically replying to
      the royal thought, "it is thus the past flies away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true, monsieur, that is true; but there remains for us, thank
      God! the future; and we will try to make it not too dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel confidence in your majesty on that head," said D'Artagnan, bowing,
      "and now&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, monsieur; I had forgotten the hundred leagues you have
      just ridden. Go, monsieur, take care of one of the best of soldiers, and
      when you have reposed a little, come and place yourself at my disposal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, absent or present, I am always yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      D'Artagnan bowed and retired. Then, as if he had only come from
      Fontainebleau, he quickly traversed the Louvre to rejoin Bragelonne.

      Chapter II. A Lover and His Mistress.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Whilst the wax-lights were burning in the castle of Blois, around the
      inanimate body of Gaston of Orleans, that last representative of the past;
      whilst the <i>bourgeois</i> of the city were thinking out his epitaph,
      which was far from being a panegyric; whilst madame the dowager, no longer
      remembering that in her young days she had loved that senseless corpse to
      such a degree as to fly the paternal palace for his sake, was making,
      within twenty paces of the funeral apartment, her little calculations of
      interest and her little sacrifices of pride; other interests and other
      prides were in agitation in all the parts of the castle into which a
      living soul could penetrate. Neither the lugubrious sounds of the bells,
      nor the voices of the chanters, nor the splendor of the wax-lights through
      the windows, nor the preparations for the funeral, had power to divert the
      attention of two persons, placed at a window of the interior court&mdash;a
      window that we are acquainted with, and which lighted a chamber forming
      part of what were called the little apartments. For the rest, a joyous
      beam of the sun, for the sun appeared to care little for the loss France
      had just suffered; a sunbeam, we say, descended upon them, drawing
      perfumes from the neighboring flowers, and animating the walls themselves.
      These two persons, so occupied, not by the death of the duke, but by the
      conversation which was the consequence of that death, were a young woman
      and a young man. The latter personage, a man of from twenty-five to
      twenty-six years of age, with a mien sometimes lively and sometimes dull,
      making good use of two large eyes, shaded with long eye-lashes, was short
      of stature and swart of skin; he smiled with an enormous, but
      well-furnished mouth, and his pointed chin, which appeared to enjoy a
      mobility nature does not ordinarily grant to that portion of the
      countenance, leant from time to time very lovingly towards his
      interlocutrix, who, we must say, did not always draw back so rapidly as
      strict propriety had a right to require. The young girl&mdash;we know her,
      for we have already seen her, at that very same window, by the light of
      that same sun&mdash;the young girl presented a singular mixture of shyness
      and reflection; she was charming when she laughed, beautiful when she
      became serious; but, let us hasten to say, she was more frequently
      charming than beautiful. These two appeared to have attained the
      culminating point of a discussion&mdash;half-bantering, half-serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Monsieur Malicorne," said the young girl, "does it, at length,
      please you that we should talk reasonably?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You believe that that is very easy, Mademoiselle Aure," replied the young
      man. "To do what we like, when we can only do what we are able&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! there he is bewildered in his phrases."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you; quit that lawyer's logic, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another impossibility. Clerk I am, Mademoiselle de Montalais."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Demoiselle I am, Monsieur Malicorne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, I know it well, and you overwhelm me by your rank; so I will say no
      more to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, no, I don't overwhelm you; say what you have to tell me&mdash;say
      it, I insist upon it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I obey you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is truly fortunate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur is dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, <i>peste!</i> that's news! And where do you come from, to be able to
      tell us that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I come from Orleans, mademoiselle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is that all the news you bring?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, no; I am come to tell you that Madame Henrietta of England is coming
      to marry the king's brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, Malicorne, you are insupportable with your news of the last
      century. Now, mind, if you persist in this bad habit of laughing at
      people, I will have you turned out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, for really you exasperate me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there. Patience, mademoiselle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want to make yourself of consequence; I know well enough why. Go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, and I will answer you frankly, yes, if the thing be true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know that I am anxious to have that commission of lady of honor,
      which I have been foolish enough to ask of you, and you do not use your
      credit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, I?" Malicorne cast down his eyes, joined his hands, and assumed his
      sullen air. "And what credit can the poor clerk of a procurer have, pray?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father has not twenty thousand livres a year for nothing, M.
      Malicorne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A provincial fortune, Mademoiselle de Montalais."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father is not in the secrets of monsieur le prince for nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An advantage which is confined to lending monseigneur money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a word, you are not the most cunning young fellow in the province for
      nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You flatter me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since I maintain that I have no credit, and you maintain I have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then,&mdash;my commission?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well,&mdash;your commission?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I have it, or shall I not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, but when?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is it, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my pocket."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How&mdash;in your pocket?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      And, with a smile, Malicorne drew from his pocket a letter, upon which
      mademoiselle seized as a prey, and which she read eagerly. As she read,
      her face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Malicorne," cried she after having read it, "In truth, you are a good
      lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for, mademoiselle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you might have been paid for this commission, and you have not."
      And she burst into a loud laugh, thinking to put the clerk out of
      countenance; but Malicorne sustained the attack bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not understand you," said he. It was now Montalais who was
      disconcerted in her turn. "I have declared my sentiments to you,"
      continued Malicorne. "You have told me three times, laughing all the
      while, that you did not love me; you have embraced me once without
      laughing, and that is all I want."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All?" said the proud and coquettish Montalais, in a tone through which
      the wounded pride was visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely all, mademoiselle," replied Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!"&mdash;And this monosyllable indicated as much anger as the young man
      might have expected gratitude. He shook his head quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, Montalais," said he, without heeding whether that familiarity
      pleased his mistress or not; "let us not dispute about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because during the year which I have known you, you might have had me
      turned out of doors twenty times if I did not please you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed; and on what account should I have had you turned out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I have been sufficiently impertinent for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that,&mdash;yes, that's true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see plainly that you are forced to avow it," said Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Malicorne!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't let us be angry; if you have retained me, then it has not been
      without cause."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not, at least, because I love you," cried Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Granted. I will even say, at this moment, I am certain that you hate me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you have never spoken so truly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, on my part, I detest you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! I take the act."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take it. You find me brutal and foolish; on my part I find you have a
      harsh voice, and your face is too often distorted with anger. At this
      moment you would allow yourself to be thrown out of that window rather
      than allow me to kiss the tip of your finger; I would precipitate myself
      from the top of the balcony rather than touch the hem of your robe. But,
      in five minutes, you will love me, and I shall adore you. Oh, it is just
      so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I doubt it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I swear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coxcomb!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then, that is not the true reason. You stand in need of me, Aure, and
      I of you. When it pleases you to be gay, I make you laugh; when it suits
      me to be loving, I look at you. I have given you a commission of lady of
      honor which you wished for; you will give me, presently, something I wish
      for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you will; but, at this moment, my dear Aure, I declare to you that I
      wish for absolutely nothing, so be at ease."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a frightful man, Malicorne; I was going to rejoice at getting
      this commission, and thus you quench my joy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good; there is no time lost,&mdash;you will rejoice when I am gone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go, then; and after&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So be it; but in the first place, a piece of advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Resume your good-humor,&mdash;you are ugly when you pout."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coarse!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, let us tell the truth to each other, while we are about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Malicorne! Bad-hearted man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Montalais! Ungrateful girl!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man leant with his elbow upon the window-frame; Montalais took a
      book and opened it. Malicorne stood up, brushed his hat with his sleeve,
      smoothed down his black doublet;&mdash;Montalais, though pretending to
      read, looked at him out of the corner of her eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" cried she, furious; "he has assumed his respectful air&mdash;and
      he will pout for a week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fortnight, mademoiselle," said Malicorne, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montalais lifted up her little doubled fist. "Monster!" said she; "oh!
      that I were a man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you do to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would strangle you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! very well, then," said Malicorne; "I believe I begin to desire
      something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what do you desire, Monsieur Demon? That I should lose my soul from
      anger?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne was rolling his hat respectfully between his fingers; but, all
      at once, he let fall his hat, seized the young girl by the shoulders,
      pulled her towards him, and sealed her mouth with two lips that were very
      warm, for a man pretending to so much indifference. Aure would have cried
      out, but the cry was stifled in his kiss. Nervous and, apparently, angry,
      the young girl pushed Malicorne against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" said Malicorne, philosophically, "that's enough for six weeks.
      Adieu, mademoiselle, accept my very humble salutation." And he made three
      steps towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! no,&mdash;you shall not go!" cried Montalais, stamping with her
      little foot. "Stay where you are! I order you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You order me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; am I not mistress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of my heart and soul, without doubt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pretty property! <i>ma foi!</i> The soul is silly and the heart dry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beware, Montalais, I know you," said Malicorne; "you are going to fall in
      love with your humble servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes!" said she, hanging round his neck with childish indolence,
      rather than with loving abandonment. "Well, yes! for I must thank you at
      least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the commission; is it not my whole future?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Montalais looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is frightful," said she, "that one can never guess whether you are
      speaking seriously or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot speak more seriously. I was going to Paris,&mdash;you are going
      there,&mdash;we are going there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so it was for that motive only you have served me; selfish fellow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you have me say, Aure? I cannot live without you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! in truth, it is just so with me; you are, nevertheless, it must be
      confessed, a very bad-hearted young man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aure, my dear Aure, take care! if you take to calling me names again, you
      know the effect they produce upon me, and I shall adore you." And so
      saying, Malicorne drew the young girl a second time towards him. But at
      that instant a step resounded on the staircase. The young people were so
      close, that they would have been surprised in the arms of each other, if
      Montalais had not violently pushed Malicorne, with his back against the
      door, just then opening. A loud cry, followed by angry reproaches,
      immediately resounded. It was Madame de Saint-Remy who uttered the cry and
      the angry words. The unlucky Malicorne almost crushed her between the wall
      and the door she was coming in at.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is again that good-for-nothing!" cried the old lady. "Always here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, madame!" replied Malicorne, in a respectful tone; "it is eight long
      days since I was here."
    </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter III. In Which We at Length See the True Heroine of this History
    </h2>
    <p>
      Appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind Madame de Saint-Remy stood Mademoiselle de la Valliere. She heard
      the explosion of maternal anger, and as she divined the cause of it, she
      entered the chamber trembling, and perceived the unlucky Malicorne, whose
      woeful countenance might have softened or set laughing whoever observed it
      coolly. He had promptly intrenched himself behind a large chair, as if to
      avoid the first attacks of Madame de Saint-Remy; he had no hopes of
      prevailing with words, for she spoke louder than he, and without stopping;
      but he reckoned upon the eloquence of his gestures. The old lady would
      neither listen to nor see anything; Malicorne had long been one of her
      antipathies. But her anger was too great not to overflow from Malicorne on
      his accomplice. Montalais had her turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you, mademoiselle; you may be certain I shall inform madame of what
      is going on in the apartment of one of her ladies of honor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, dear mother!" cried Mademoiselle de la Valliere, "for mercy's sake,
      spare&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold your tongue, mademoiselle, and do not uselessly trouble yourself to
      intercede for unworthy people; that a young maid of honor like you should
      be subjected to a bad example is, certes, a misfortune great enough; but
      that you should sanction it by your indulgence is what I will not allow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But in truth," said Montalais, rebelling again, "I do not know under what
      pretense you treat me thus. I am doing no harm, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that great good-for-nothing, mademoiselle," resumed Madame de
      Saint-Remy, pointing to Malicorne, "is he here to do any good, I ask you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is neither here for good nor harm, madame; he comes to see me, that is
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all very well! all very well!" said the old lady. "Her royal
      highness shall be informed of it, and she will judge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events, I do not see why," replied Montalais, "it should be
      forbidden M. Malicorne to have intentions towards me, if his intentions
      are honorable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Honorable intentions with such a face!" cried Madame de Saint-Remy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you in the name of my face, madame," said Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, my daughter, come," continued Madame de Saint-Remy; "we will go and
      inform madame that at the very moment she is weeping for her husband, at
      the moment when we are all weeping for a master in this old castle of
      Blois, the abode of grief, there are people who amuse themselves with
      flirtations!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" cried both the accused, with one voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A maid of honor! a maid of honor!" cried the old lady, lifting her hands
      towards heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! it is there you are mistaken, madame," said Montalais, highly
      exasperated; "I am no longer a maid of honor, of madame's at least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you given in your resignation, mademoiselle? That is well! I cannot
      but applaud such a determination, and I do applaud it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not give in my resignation, madame; I take another service,&mdash;that
      is all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the <i>bourgeoisie</i> or in the <i>robe?</i>" asked Madame de
      Saint-Remy, disdainfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please to learn, madame, that I am not a girl to serve either <i>bourgeoises</i>
      or <i>robines</i>; and that instead of the miserable court at which you
      vegetate, I am going to reside in a court almost royal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, ha! a royal court," said Madame de Saint-Remy, forcing a laugh; "a
      royal court! What do you think of that, my daughter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And she turned towards Mademoiselle de la Valliere, whom she would by main
      force have dragged away from Montalais, and who instead of obeying the
      impulse of Madame de Saint-Remy, looked first at her mother and then at
      Montalais with her beautiful conciliatory eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not say a royal court, madame," replied Montalais; "because Madame
      Henrietta of England, who is about to become the wife of S. A. R.
      Monsieur, is not a queen. I said almost royal, and I spoke correctly,
      since she will be sister-in-law to the king."
    </p>
    <p>
      A thunderbolt falling upon the castle of Blois would not have astonished
      Madame de Saint-Remy more than the last sentence of Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you say? of Son Altesse Royale Madame Henrietta?" stammered out
      the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say I am going to belong to her household, as maid of honor; that is
      what I say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As maid of honor!" cried, at the same time, Madame de Saint-Remy with
      despair, and Mademoiselle de la Valliere with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madame, as maid of honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady's head sank down as if the blow had been too severe for her.
      But, almost immediately recovering herself, she launched a last projectile
      at her adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! oh!" said she; "I have heard of many of these sorts of promises
      beforehand, which often lead people to flatter themselves with wild hopes,
      and at the last moment, when the time comes to keep the promises, and have
      the hopes realized, they are surprised to see the great credit upon which
      they reckoned vanish like smoke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! madame, the credit of my protector is incontestable and his promises
      are as good as deeds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And would it be indiscreet to ask you the name of this powerful
      protector?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! <i>mon Dieu!</i> no! it is that gentleman there," said Montalais,
      pointing to Malicorne, who, during this scene, had preserved the most
      imperturbable coolness, and the most comic dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur!" cried Madame de Saint-Remy, with an explosion of hilarity,
      "monsieur is your protector! Is the man whose credit is so powerful, and
      whose promises are as good as deeds, Monsieur Malicorne!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Montalais, as her sole reply, she drew the brevet from her pocket,
      and showed it to the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is the <i>brevet</i>," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once all was over. As soon as she had cast a rapid glance over this
      fortunate <i>brevet</i>, the good lady clasped her hands, an unspeakable
      expression of envy and despair contracted her countenance, and she was
      obliged to sit down to avoid fainting. Montalais was not malicious enough
      to rejoice extravagantly at her victory, or to overwhelm the conquered
      enemy, particularly when that enemy was the mother of her friend; she used
      then, but did not abuse her triumph. Malicorne was less generous; he
      assumed noble <i>poses</i> in his <i>fauteuil</i> and stretched himself
      out with a familiarity which, two hours earlier, would have drawn upon him
      threats of a caning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maid of honor to the young madame!" repeated Madame de Saint-Remy, still
      but half convinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madame, and through the protection of M. Malicorne, moreover."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is incredible!" repeated the old lady: "is it not incredible, Louise?"
      But Louise did not reply; she was sitting, thoughtfully, almost sad;
      passing one had over her beautiful brow, she sighed heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but, monsieur," said Madame de Saint-Remy, all at once, "how did
      you manage to obtain this post?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I asked for it, madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of my friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have friends sufficiently powerful at court to give you such
      proofs of their credit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It appears so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And may one ask the name of these friends?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not say I had many friends, madame, I said I had one friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that friend is called?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Peste!</i> madame, you go too far! When one has a friend as powerful
      as mine, we do not publish his name in that fashion, in open day, in order
      that he may be stolen from us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, monsieur, to be silent as to that name; for I think it
      would be pretty difficult for you to tell it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events," said Montalais, "if the friend does not exist, the <i>brevet</i>
      does, and that cuts short the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, I conceive," said Madame de Saint-Remy, with the gracious smile of
      the cat who is going to scratch, "when I found monsieur here just now&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He brought you the <i>brevet</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly, madame; you have guessed rightly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, nothing can be more moral or proper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so, madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I have been wrong, as it appears, in reproaching you, mademoiselle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very wrong, madame; but I am so accustomed to your reproaches, that I
      pardon you these."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, let us begone, Louise; we have nothing to do but retire.
      Well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame!" said La Valliere starting, "did you speak?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not appear to be listening, my child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madame, I was thinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thousand things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bear me no ill-will, at least, Louise?" cried Montalais, pressing her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why should I, my dear Aure?" replied the girl in a voice soft as a
      flute.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Dame!</i>" resumed Madame de Saint-Remy; "if she did bear you a little
      ill-will, poor girl, she could not be much blamed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why should she bear me ill-will, good gracious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It appears to me that she is of as good a family, and as pretty as you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mother! mother!" cried Louise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prettier a hundred times, madame&mdash;not of a better family; but that
      does not tell me why Louise should bear me ill-will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think it will be very amusing for her to be buried alive at Blois,
      when you are going to shine at Paris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, madame, it is not I who prevent Louise following me thither; on the
      contrary, I should certainly be most happy if she came there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it appears that M. Malicorne, who is all-powerful at court&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! so much the worse, madame," said Malicorne, "every one for himself in
      this poor world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Malicorne! Malicorne!" said Montalais. Then stooping towards the young
      man:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Occupy Madame de Saint-Remy, either in disputing with her, or making it
      up with her; I must speak to Louise." And, at the same time, a soft
      pressure of the hand recompensed Malicorne for his future obedience.
      Malicorne went grumbling towards Madame de Saint-Remy, whilst Montalais
      said to her friend, throwing one arm around her neck:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter? Tell <i>me</i>. Is it true that you would not love me
      if I were to shine, as your mother says?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no!" said the young girl, with difficulty restraining her tears; "on
      the contrary, I rejoice at your good fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rejoice! why, one would say you are ready to cry!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do people never weep except from envy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! yes, I understand; I am going to Paris and that word Paris recalls to
      your mind a certain cavalier&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aure!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A certain cavalier who formerly lived near Blois, and who now resides at
      Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In truth, I know not what ails me, but I feel stifled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Weep, then, weep, as you cannot give me a smile!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Louise raised her sweet face, which the tears, rolling down one after the
      other, illumined like diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, confess," said Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall I confess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What makes you weep; people don't weep without cause. I am your friend;
      whatever you would wish me to do, I will do. Malicorne is more powerful
      than you would think. Do you wish to go to Paris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" sighed Louise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you wish to come to Paris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To remain here alone, in this old castle, I who have enjoyed the
      delightful habit of listening to your songs, of pressing your hand, of
      running about the park with you. Oh! how I shall be <i>ennuyee!</i> how
      quickly I shall die!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you wish to come to Paris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Louise breathed another sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not answer me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you that I should reply?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes or no; that is not very difficult, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! you are very fortunate, Montalais!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is to say you would like to be in my place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Louise was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little obstinate thing!" said Montalais; "did ever any one keep her
      secrets from her friend thus? But, confess that you would like to come to
      Paris; confess that you are dying with the wish to see Raoul again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot confess that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you are wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because&mdash;do you not see this <i>brevet?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I would have got you a similar one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By whose means?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Malicorne's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aure, are you telling the truth? Is that possible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Malicorne is there; and what he has done for me, he surely can do for
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne had heard his name pronounced twice; he was delighted at having
      an opportunity of coming to a conclusion with Madame de Saint-Remy, and he
      turned round:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the question, mademoiselle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come hither, Malicorne," said Montalais, with an imperious gesture.
      Malicorne obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A <i>brevet</i> like this," said Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A <i>brevet</i> like this; that is plain enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want one&mdash;I must have one!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! oh! you must have one!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is impossible, is it not, M. Malicorne?" said Louise, with her sweet,
      soft voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it is for <i>you</i>, mademoiselle&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For me. Yes, Monsieur Malicorne, it <i>would</i> be for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if Mademoiselle de Montalais asks it at the same time&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle de Montalais does not ask it, she requires it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! we will endeavor to obey you, mademoiselle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will have her named?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will try."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No evasive answers, Louise de la Valliere shall be maid of honor to
      Madame Henrietta within a week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How you talk!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Within a week, or else&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! or else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may take back your <i>brevet</i>, Monsieur Malicorne; I will not
      leave my friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Montalais!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is right. Keep your <i>brevet</i>; Mademoiselle de la Valliere shall
      be a maid of honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that true?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may then hope to go to Paris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Depend on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Monsieur Malicorne, what joy!" cried Louise, clapping her hands, and
      bounding with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little dissembler!" said Montalais, "try again to make me believe you are
      not in love with Raoul."
    </p>
    <p>
      Louise blushed like a rose in June, but instead of replying, she ran and
      embraced her mother. "Madame," said she, "do you know that M. Malicorne is
      going to have me appointed maid of honor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. Malicorne is a prince in disguise," replied the old lady, "he is
      all-powerful, seemingly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Should you also like to be a maid of honor?" asked Malicorne of Madame de
      Saint-Remy. "Whilst I am about it, I might as well get everybody
      appointed."
    </p>
    <p>
      And upon that he went away, leaving the poor lady quite disconcerted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph!" murmured Malicorne as he descended the stairs,&mdash;"Humph!
      there goes another note of a thousand livres! but I must get through as
      well as I can; my friend Manicamp does nothing for nothing."

    <h2>
      Chapter IV. Malicorne and Manicamp.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The introduction of these two new personages into this history and that
      mysterious affinity of names and sentiments, merit some attention on the
      part of both historian and reader. We will then enter into some details
      concerning Messieurs Malicorne and Manicamp. Malicorne, we know, had made
      the journey to Orleans in search of the <i>brevet</i> destined for
      Mademoiselle de Montalais, the arrival of which had produced such a strong
      feeling at the castle of Blois. At that moment, M. de Manicamp was at
      Orleans. A singular person was this M. de Manicamp; a very intelligent
      young fellow, always poor, always needy, although he dipped his hand
      freely into the purse of M. le Comte de Guiche, one of the best furnished
      purses of the period. M. le Comte de Guiche had had, as the companion of
      his boyhood, this De Manicamp, a poor gentleman, vassal-born, of the house
      of Gramont. M. de Manicamp, with his tact and talent had created himself a
      revenue in the opulent family of the celebrated marechal. From his infancy
      he had, with calculation beyond his age, lent his mane and complaisance to
      the follies of the Comte de Guiche. If his noble companion had stolen some
      fruit destined for Madame la Marechale, if he had broken a mirror, or put
      out a dog's eye, Manicamp declared himself guilty of the crime committed,
      and received the punishment, which was not made the milder for falling on
      the innocent. But this was the way this system of abnegation was paid for:
      instead of wearing such mean habiliments as his paternal fortunes entitled
      him to, he was able to appear brilliant, superb, like a young noble of
      fifty thousand livres a year. It was not that he was mean in character or
      humble in spirit; no, he was a philosopher, or rather he had the
      indifference, the apathy, the obstinacy which banish from man every
      sentiment of the supernatural. His sole ambition was to spend money. But,
      in this respect, the worthy M. de Manicamp was a gulf. Three or four times
      every year he drained the Comte de Guiche, and when the Comte de Guiche
      was thoroughly drained, when he had turned out his pockets and his purse
      before him, when he declared that it would be at least a fortnight before
      paternal munificence would refill those pockets and that purse, Manicamp
      lost all his energy, he went to bed, remained there, ate nothing and sold
      his handsome clothes, under the pretense that, remaining in bed, he did
      not want them. During this prostration of mind and strength, the purse of
      the Comte de Guiche was getting full again, and when once filled,
      overflowed into that of De Manicamp, who bought new clothes, dressed
      himself again, and recommenced the same life he had followed before. The
      mania of selling his new clothes for a quarter of what they were worth,
      had rendered our hero sufficiently celebrated in Orleans, a city where, in
      general, we should be puzzled to say why he came to pass his days of
      penitence. Provincial <i>debauches, petits-maitres</i> of six hundred
      livres a year, shared the fragments of his opulence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the admirers of these splendid toilettes, our friend Malicorne was
      conspicuous; he was the son of a syndic of the city, of whom M. de Conde,
      always needy as a De Conde, often borrowed money at enormous interest. M.
      Malicorne kept the paternal money-chest; that is to say, that in those
      times of easy morals, he had made for himself, by following the example of
      his father, and lending at high interest for short terms, a revenue of
      eighteen hundred livres, without reckoning six hundred livres furnished by
      the generosity of the syndic; so that Malicorne was the king of the gay
      youth of Orleans, having two thousand four hundred livres to scatter,
      squander, and waste on follies of every kind. But, quite contrary to
      Manicamp, Malicorne was terribly ambitious. He loved from ambition; he
      spent money out of ambition; and he would have ruined himself for
      ambition. Malicorne had determined to rise, at whatever price it might
      cost, and for this, whatever price it did cost, he had given himself a
      mistress and a friend. The mistress, Mademoiselle de Montalais, was cruel,
      as regarded love; but she was of a noble family, and that was sufficient
      for Malicorne. The friend had little or no friendship, but he was the
      favorite of the Comte de Guiche, himself the friend of Monsieur, the
      king's brother; and that was sufficient for Malicorne. Only, in the
      chapter of charges, Mademoiselle de Montalais cost <i>per annum</i>:&mdash;ribbons,
      gloves, and sweets, a thousand livres. De Manicamp cost&mdash;money lent,
      never returned&mdash;from twelve to fifteen hundred livres <i>per annum</i>.
      So that there was nothing left for Malicorne. Ah! yes, we are mistaken;
      there was left the paternal strong box. He employed a mode of proceeding,
      upon which he preserved the most profound secrecy, and which consisted in
      advancing to himself, from the coffers of the syndic, half a dozen year's
      profits, that is to say, fifteen thousand livres, swearing to himself&mdash;observe,
      quite to himself&mdash;to repay this deficiency as soon as an opportunity
      should present itself. The opportunity was expected to be the concession
      of a good post in the household of Monsieur, when that household would be
      established at the period of his marriage. This juncture had arrived, and
      the household was about to be established. A good post in the family of a
      prince of the blood, when it is given by the credit, and on the
      recommendation of a friend, like the Comte de Guiche, is worth at least
      twelve thousand livres <i>per annum</i>; and by the means which M.
      Malicorne had taken to make his revenues fructify, twelve thousand livres
      might rise to twenty thousand. Then, when once an incumbent of this post,
      he would marry Mademoiselle de Montalais. Mademoiselle de Montalais, of a
      half noble family, not only would be dowered, but would ennoble Malicorne.
      But, in order that Mademoiselle de Montalais, who had not a large
      patrimonial fortune, although an only daughter, should be suitably
      dowered, it was necessary that she should belong to some great princess,
      as prodigal as the dowager Madame was covetous. And in order that the wife
      should not be of one party whilst the husband belonged to the other, a
      situation which presents serious inconveniences, particularly with
      characters like those of the future consorts&mdash;Malicorne had imagined
      the idea of making the central point of union the household of Monsieur,
      the king's brother. Mademoiselle de Montalais would be maid of honor to
      Madame. M. Malicorne would be officer to Monsieur.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is plain the plan was formed by a clear head; it is plain, also, that
      it had been bravely executed. Malicorne had asked Manicamp to ask a <i>brevet</i>
      of maid of honor of the Comte de Guiche; and the Comte de Guiche had asked
      this <i>brevet</i> of Monsieur, who had signed it without hesitation. The
      constructive plan of Malicorne&mdash;for we may well suppose that the
      combinations of a mind as active as his were not confined to the present,
      but extended to the future&mdash;the constructive plan of Malicorne, we
      say, was this:&mdash;To obtain entrance into the household of Madame
      Henrietta for a woman devoted to himself, who was intelligent, young,
      handsome, and intriguing; to learn, by means of this woman, all the
      feminine secrets of the young household; whilst he, Malicorne, and his
      friend Manicamp, should, between them, know all the male secrets of the
      young community. It was by these means that a rapid and splendid fortune
      might be acquired at one and the same time. Malicorne was a vile name; he
      who bore it had too much wit to conceal this truth from himself; but an
      estate might be purchased; and Malicorne of some place, or even De
      Malicorne itself, for short, would ring more nobly on the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not improbable that a most aristocratic origin might be hunted up
      by the heralds for this name of Malicorne; might it not come from some
      estate where a bull with mortal horns had caused some great misfortune,
      and baptized the soil with the blood it had spilt? Certes, this plan
      presented itself bristling with difficulties: but the greatest of all was
      Mademoiselle de Montalais herself. Capricious, variable, close, giddy,
      free, prudish, a virgin armed with claws, Erigone stained with grapes, she
      sometimes overturned, with a single dash of her white fingers, or with a
      single puff from her laughing lips, the edifice which had exhausted
      Malicorne's patience for a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love apart, Malicorne was happy; but this love, which he could not help
      feeling, he had the strength to conceal with care; persuaded that at the
      least relaxing of the ties by which he had bound his Protean female, the
      demon would overthrow and laugh at him. He humbled his mistress by
      disdaining her. Burning with desire, when she advanced to tempt him, he
      had the art to appear ice, persuaded that if he opened his arms, she would
      run away laughing at him. On her side, Montalais believed she did not love
      Malicorne; whilst, on the contrary, in reality she did. Malicorne repeated
      to her so often his protestation of indifference, that she finished,
      sometimes, by believing him; and then she believed she detested Malicorne.
      If she tried to bring him back by coquetry, Malicorne played the coquette
      better than she could. But what made Montalais hold to Malicorne in an
      indissoluble fashion, was that Malicorne always came cram full of fresh
      news from the court and the city; Malicorne always brought to Blois a
      fashion, a secret, or a perfume; that Malicorne never asked for a meeting,
      but, on the contrary, required to be supplicated to receive the favors he
      burned to obtain. On her side, Montalais was no miser with stories. By her
      means, Malicorne learnt all that passed at Blois, in the family of the
      dowager Madame; and he related to Manicamp tales that made him ready to
      die with laughing, which the latter, out of idleness, took ready-made to
      M. de Guiche, who carried them to Monsieur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, in two words, was the woof of petty interests and petty conspiracies
      which united Blois with Orleans, and Orleans with Pairs; and which was
      about to bring into the last named city where she was to produce so great
      a revolution, the poor little La Valliere, who was far from suspecting, as
      she returned joyfully, leaning on the arm of her mother, for what a
      strange future she was reserved. As to the good man, Malicorne&mdash;we
      speak of the syndic of Orleans&mdash;he did not see more clearly into the
      present than others did into the future; and had no suspicion as he
      walked, every day, between three and five o'clock, after his dinner, upon
      the Place Sainte-Catherine, in his gray coat, cut after the fashion of
      Louis XIII. and his cloth shoes with great knots of ribbon, that it was he
      who was paying for all those bursts of laughter, all those stolen kisses,
      all those whisperings, all those little keepsakes, and all those bubble
      projects which formed a chain of forty-five leagues in length, from the
      palais of Blois to the Palais Royal.

    <h2>
      Chapter V: Manicamp and Malicorne.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Malicorne, then, left Blois, as we have said, and went to find his friend,
      Manicamp, then in temporary retreat in the city of Orleans. It was just at
      the moment when that young nobleman was employed in selling the last
      decent clothing he had left. He had, a fortnight before, extorted from the
      Comte de Guiche a hundred pistoles, all he had, to assist in equipping him
      properly to go and meet Madame, on her arrival at Le Havre. He had drawn
      from Malicorne, three days before, fifty pistoles, the price of the <i>brevet</i>
      obtained for Montalais. He had then no expectation of anything else,
      having exhausted all his resources, with the exception of selling a
      handsome suit of cloth and satin, embroidered and laced with gold, which
      had been the admiration of the court. But to be able to sell this suit,
      the last he had left,&mdash;as we have been forced to confess to the
      reader&mdash;Manicamp had been obliged to take to his bed. No more fire,
      no more pocket-money, no more walking-money, nothing but sleep to take the
      place of repasts, companies and balls. It has been said&mdash;"He who
      sleeps, dines;" but it has never been affirmed&mdash;He who sleeps, plays&mdash;or,
      He who sleeps, dances. Manicamp, reduced to this extremity of neither
      playing nor dancing, for a week at least, was, consequently, very sad; he
      was expecting a usurer, and saw Malicorne enter. A cry of distress escaped
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh! what!" said he, in a tone which nothing can describe, "is that you
      again, dear friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Humph! you are very polite!" said Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, but look you, I was expecting money, and, instead of money, I see <i>you</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And suppose I brought you some money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! that would be quite another thing. You are very welcome, my dear
      friend!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And he held out his hand, not for the hand of Malicorne, but for the
      purse. Malicorne pretended to be mistaken, and gave him his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the money?" said Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear friend, if you wish to have it, earn it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What must be done for it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Earn it, <i>parbleu!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And after what fashion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! that is rather trying, I warn you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The devil!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must get out of bed, and go immediately to M. le Comte de Guiche."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I get up!" said Manicamp, stretching himself in his bed, complacently,
      "oh, no, thank you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have sold all your clothes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I have one suit left, the handsomest even, but I expect a purchaser."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the <i>chausses?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if you look, you will see them on that chair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well! since you have some <i>chausses</i> and a <i>pourpoint</i>
      left, put your legs into the first and your back into the other; have a
      horse saddled, and set off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Morbleu!</i> don't you know, then, that M. de Guiche is at Etampes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I thought he was at Paris. You will then only have fifteen leagues to
      go, instead of thirty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a wonderfully clever fellow! If I were to ride fifteen leagues in
      these clothes, they would never be fit to put on again; and, instead of
      selling them for thirty pistoles, I should be obliged to take fifteen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sell them for whatever you like, but I must have a second commission of
      maid of honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! for whom? Is Montalais doubled, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vile fellow!&mdash;It is you who are doubled. You swallow up two fortunes&mdash;mine,
      and that of M. le Comte de Guiche."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should say, that of M. le Comte de Guiche and yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true; honor where it is due; but I return to my <i>brevet</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prove me that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend, there will only be twelve maids of honor for madame; I have
      already obtained for you what twelve hundred women are trying for, and for
      that I was forced to employ all my diplomacy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! yes, I know you have been quite heroic, my dear friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We know what we are about," said Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To whom do you tell that? When I am king, I promise you one thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? To call yourself Malicorne the First?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; to make you superintendent of my finances; but that is not the
      question now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unfortunately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The present affair is to procure for me a second place of maid of honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend, if you were to promise me the price of heaven, I would decline
      to disturb myself at this moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne chinked the money in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are twenty pistoles here," said Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what would you do with twenty pistoles, <i>mon Dieu!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" said Malicorne, a little angry, "suppose I were to add them to the
      five hundred you already owe me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," replied Manicamp, stretching out his hand again, "and
      from that point of view I can accept them. Give them to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An instant, what the devil! it is not only holding out your hand that
      will do; if I give you the twenty pistoles, shall I have my <i>brevet?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure you shall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Soon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! take care! Monsieur de Manicamp; you undertake much, and I do not ask
      that. Thirty leagues in a day is too much, you would kill yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think nothing impossible when obliging a friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite heroic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are the twenty pistoles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here they are," said Malicorne, showing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but my dear M. Manicamp, you would consume them in post-horses
      alone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, make yourself easy on that score."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me. Why, it is fifteen leagues from this place to Etampes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fourteen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! fourteen be it; fourteen leagues makes seven posts; at twenty <i>sous</i>
      the post, seven <i>livres</i>; seven <i>livres</i> the courier, fourteen;
      as many for coming back, twenty-eight! as much for bed and supper, that
      makes sixty <i>livres</i> this complaisance would cost."
    </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp stretched himself like a serpent in his bed, and fixing his two
      great eyes upon Malicorne, "You are right," said he; "I could not return
      before to-morrow;" and he took the twenty pistoles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, then, be off!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as I cannot be back before to-morrow, we have time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time for what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time to play."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you wish to play with?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your twenty pistoles, <i>pardieu!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; you always win."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will wager them, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Against what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Against twenty others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what shall be the object of the wager?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This. We have said it was fourteen leagues to Etampes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And fourteen leagues back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doubtless."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well; for these twenty-eight leagues you cannot allow less than fourteen
      hours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is agreed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One hour to find the Comte de Guiche."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And an hour to persuade him to write a letter to Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sixteen hours in all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You reckon as well as M. Colbert."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is now twelve o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Half-past."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Hein!</i>&mdash;you have a handsome watch!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What were you saying?" said Malicorne, putting his watch quickly back
      into his fob.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! true; I was offering to lay you twenty pistoles against these you
      have lent me, that you will have the Comte de Guiche's letter in&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How soon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In eight hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you a winged horse, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is no matter. Will you bet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have the comte's letter in eight hours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In hand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, be it so; I lay," said Malicorne, curious enough to know how this
      seller of clothes would get through.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it agreed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pass me the pen, ink, and paper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here they are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp raised himself with a sigh, and leaning on his left elbow, in his
      best hand, traced the following lines:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good for an order for a place of maid of honor to Madame, which M. le
      Comte de Guiche will take upon him to obtain at sight. DE MANICAMP."
    </p>
    <p>
      This painful task accomplished, he laid himself down in bed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" asked Malicorne, "what does this mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That means that if you are in a hurry to have the letter from the Comte
      de Guiche for Monsieur, I have won my wager."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How the devil is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is transparent enough, I think; you take that paper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you set out instead of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You put your horses to their best speed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In six hours you will be at Etampes; in seven hours you have the letter
      from the comte, and I shall have won my wager without stirring from my
      bed, which suits me and you too, at the same time, I am very sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Decidedly, Manicamp, you are a great man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Hein!</i> I know that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am to start then for Etampes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Directly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am to go to the Comte de Guiche with this order?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will give you a similar one for Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur will approve?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Instantly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I shall have my <i>brevet?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I hope I behave genteely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adorably."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do as you please, then, with the Comte de Guiche, Manicamp?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Except making money of him&mdash;everything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Diable!</i> the exception is annoying; but then, if instead of asking
      him for money, you were to ask&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something important."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you call important?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! suppose one of your friends asked you to render him a service?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would not render it to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Selfish fellow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or at least I would ask him what service he would render me in exchange."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! that, perhaps, is fair. Well, that friend speaks to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, you, Malicorne?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! ah! you are rich, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have still fifty pistoles left."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly the sum I want. Where are those fifty pistoles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here," said Malicorne, slapping his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then speak, my friend; what do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne took up the pen, ink, and paper again, and presented them all to
      Manicamp. "Write!" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dictate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An order for a place in the household of Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Manicamp, laying down the pen, "a place in the household of
      Monsieur for fifty pistoles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mistook me, my friend; you did not hear plainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you say, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said five hundred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the five hundred?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here they are."
    </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp devoured the rouleau with his eyes; but this time Malicorne held
      it at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh! what do you say to that? Five hundred pistoles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say it is for nothing, my friend," said Manicamp, taking up the pen
      again, "and you exhaust my credit. Dictate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which my friend the Comte de Guiche will obtain for my friend Malicorne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it," said Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, you have forgotten to sign."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! that is true. The five hundred pistoles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here are two hundred and fifty of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the other two hundred and fifty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I am in possession of my place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp made a face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case give me the recommendation back again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To add two words to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two words?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; two words only."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In haste."
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne returned the recommendation; Manicamp added the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good," said Malicorne, taking back the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp began to count out the pistoles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There want twenty," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The twenty I have won."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By laying that you would have the letter from the Comte de Guiche in
      eight hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! that's fair," and he gave him the twenty pistoles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp began to scoop up his gold by handfuls, and pour it in cascades
      upon his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This second place," murmured Malicorne, whilst drying his paper, "which,
      at first glance appears to cost me more than the first, but&mdash;" He
      stopped, took up the pen in his turn, and wrote to Montalais:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "MADEMOISELLE,&mdash;Announce to your friend that her commission will not
      be long before it arrives; I am setting out to get it signed: that will be
      twenty-eight leagues I shall have gone for the love of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with his sardonic smile, taking up the interrupted sentence:&mdash;"This
      place," said he, "at first glance, appears to have cost more than the
      first; but&mdash;the benefit will be, I hope, in proportion with the
      expense, and Mademoiselle de la Valliere will bring me back more than
      Mademoiselle de Montalais, or else,&mdash;or else my name is not
      Malicorne. Farewell, Manicamp," and he left the room.

    <h2>
      Chapter VI. The Courtyard of the Hotel Grammont.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On Malicorne's arrival at Orleans, he was informed that the Comte de
      Guiche had just set out for Paris. Malicorne rested himself for a couple
      of hours, and then prepared to continue his journey. He reached Paris
      during the night, and alighted at a small hotel, where, in his previous
      journeys to the capital, he had been accustomed to put up, and at eight
      o'clock the next morning presented himself at the Hotel Grammont.
      Malicorne arrived just in time, for the Comte de Guiche was on the point
      of taking leave of Monsieur before setting out for Le Havre, where the
      principal members of the French nobility had gone to await Madame's
      arrival from England. Malicorne pronounced the name of Manicamp, and was
      immediately admitted. He found the Comte de Guiche in the courtyard of the
      Hotel Grammont, inspecting his horses, which his trainers and equerries
      were passing in review before him. The count, in the presence of his
      tradespeople and of his servants, was engaged in praising or blaming, as
      the case seemed to deserve, the appointments, horses, and harness that
      were being submitted to him; when, in the midst of this important
      occupation, the name of Manicamp was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Manicamp!" he exclaimed; "let him enter by all means." And he advanced a
      few steps toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne slipped through the half-open door, and looking at the Comte de
      Guiche, who was surprised to see a face he did not recognize, instead of
      the one he expected, said: "Forgive me, monsieur le comte, but I believe a
      mistake has been made. M. Manicamp himself was announced to you, instead
      of which it is only an envoy from him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" exclaimed De Guiche, coldly; "and what do you bring me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A letter, monsieur le comte." Malicorne handed him the first document,
      and narrowly watched the count's face, who, as he read it, began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" he exclaimed, "another maid of honor? Are all the maids of honor
      in France, then, under his protection?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why does he not come himself?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is confined to his bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The deuce! he has no money then, I suppose," said De Guiche, shrugging
      his shoulders. "What does he do with his money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne made a movement, to indicate that upon this subject he was as
      ignorant as the count himself. "Why does he not make use of his credit,
      then?" continued De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With regard to that, I think&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That Manicamp has credit with no one but yourself, monsieur le comte!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will not be at Le Havre, then?" Whereupon Malicorne made another
      movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But every one will be there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust, monsieur le comte, that he will not neglect so excellent an
      opportunity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He should be at Paris by this time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will take the direct road perhaps to make up for lost time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is he now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At Orleans."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," said De Guiche, "you seem to me a man of very good taste."
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne was wearing some of Manicamp's old-new clothes. He bowed in
      return, saying, "You do me a very great honor, monsieur le comte."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom have I the pleasure of addressing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Malicorne, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Malicorne, what do you think of these pistol-holsters?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne was a man of great readiness and immediately understood the
      position of affairs. Besides, the "de" which had been prefixed to his
      name, raised him to the rank of the person with whom he was conversing. He
      looked at the holsters with the air of a connoisseur and said, without
      hesitation: "Somewhat heavy, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," said De Guiche to the saddler, "this gentleman, who understands
      these matters well, thinks the holsters heavy, a complaint I had already
      made." The saddler was full of excuses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think," asked De Guiche, "of this horse, which I have just
      purchased?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To look at it, it seems perfect, monsieur le comte; but I must mount it
      before I give you my opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so, M. de Malicorne, and ride him round the court two or three times."
    </p>
    <p>
      The courtyard of the hotel was so arranged, that whenever there was any
      occasion for it, it could be used as a riding-school. Malicorne, with
      perfect ease, arranged the bridle and snaffle-reins, placed his left hand
      on the horse's mane, and, with his foot in the stirrup, raised himself and
      seated himself in the saddle. At first, he made the horse walk the whole
      circuit of the court-yard at a foot-pace; next at a trot; lastly at a
      gallop. He then drew up close to the count, dismounted, and threw the
      bridle to a groom standing by. "Well," said the count, "what do you think
      of it, M. de Malicorne?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This horse, monsieur le comte, is of the Mecklenburg breed. In looking
      whether the bit suited his mouth, I saw that he was rising seven, the very
      age when the training of a horse intended for a charger should commence.
      The forehand is light. A horse which holds its head high, it is said,
      never tires his rider's hand. The withers are rather low. The drooping of
      the hind-quarters would almost make me doubt the purity of its German
      breed, and I think there is English blood in him. He stands well on his
      legs, but he trots high, and may cut himself, which requires attention to
      be paid to his shoeing. He is tractable; and as I made him turn round and
      change his feet, I found him quick and ready in doing so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well said, M. de Malicorne," exclaimed the comte; "you are a judge of
      horses, I perceive;" then, turning towards him again, he continued, "you
      are most becomingly dressed, M. de Malicorne. That is not a provincial
      cut, I presume. Such a style of dress is not to be met with at Tours or
      Orleans."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, monsieur le comte; my clothes were made at Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no doubt about that. But let us resume our own affair. Manicamp
      wishes for the appointment of a second maid of honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You perceive what he has written, monsieur le comte."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For whom was the first appointment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne felt the color rise in his face as he answered hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A charming maid of honor, Mademoiselle de Montalais."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, ah! you are acquainted with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are affianced, or nearly so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is quite another thing, then; a thousand compliments," exclaimed De
      Guiche, upon whose lips a courtier's jest was already fitting, but to whom
      the word "affianced," addressed by Malicorne with respect to Mademoiselle
      de Montalais, recalled the respect due to women.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for whom is the second appointment destined?" asked De Guiche; "is it
      for anyone to whom Manicamp may happen to be affianced? In that case I
      pity her, poor girl! for she will have a sad fellow for a husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, monsieur le comte; the second appointment is for Mademoiselle de la
      Baume le Blanc de la Valliere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unknown," said De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unknown? yes, monsieur," said Malicorne, smiling in his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good. I will speak to Monsieur about it. By the by, she is of gentle
      birth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She belongs to a very good family and is maid of honor to Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's well. Will you accompany me to Monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most certainly, if I may be permitted the honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you your carriage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I came here on horseback."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dressed as you are?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, monsieur; I posted from Orleans, and I changed my traveling suit for
      the one I have on, in order to present myself to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, you already told me you had come from Orleans;" saying which he
      crumpled Manicamp's letter in his hand, and thrust it in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon," said Malicorne, timidly; "but I do not think you have
      read all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not read all, do you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; there were two letters in the same envelope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! are you sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us look, then," said the count, as he opened the letter again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! you are right," he said opening the paper which he had not yet read.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suspected it," he continued&mdash;"another application for an
      appointment under Monsieur. This Manicamp is a regular vampire:&mdash;he
      is carrying on a trade in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, monsieur le comte, he wishes to make a present of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To myself, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you not say so at once, my dear M. Mauvaisecorne?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Malicorne, monsieur le comte."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me; it is that Latin that bothers me&mdash;that terrible mine of
      etymologies. Why the deuce are young men of family taught Latin? <i>Mala</i>
      and <i>mauvaise</i>&mdash;you understand it is the same thing. You will
      forgive me, I trust, M. de Malicorne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your kindness affects me much, monsieur: but it is a reason why I should
      make you acquainted with one circumstance without any delay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I was not born a gentleman. I am not without courage, and not
      altogether deficient in ability; but my name is Malicorne simply."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You appear to me, monsieur!" exclaimed the count, looking at the astute
      face of his companion, "to be a most agreeable man. Your face pleases me,
      M. Malicorne, and you must possess some indisputably excellent qualities
      to have pleased that egotistical Manicamp. Be candid and tell me whether
      you are not some saint descended upon the earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the simple reason that he makes you a present of anything. Did you
      not say that he intended to make you a present of some appointment in the
      king's household?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, count; but, if I succeed in obtaining the appointment,
      you, and not he, will have bestowed it on me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides he will not have given it to you for nothing, I suppose. Stay, I
      have it;&mdash;there is a Malicorne at Orleans who lends money to the
      prince."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think that must be my father, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! the prince has the father, and that terrible dragon of a Manicamp has
      the son. Take care, monsieur, I know him. He will fleece you completely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The only difference is, that I lend without interest," said Malicorne,
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was correct in saying you were either a saint or very much resembled
      one. M. Malicorne, you shall have the post you want, or I will forfeit my
      name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! monsieur le comte, what a debt of gratitude shall I not owe you?"
      said Malicorne, transported.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us go to the prince, my dear M. Malicorne." And De Guiche proceeded
      toward the door, desiring Malicorne to follow him. At the very moment they
      were about to cross the threshold, a young man appeared on the other side.
      He was from twenty-four to twenty-five years of age, of pale complexion,
      bright eyes and brown hair and eyebrows. "Good-day," said he, suddenly,
      almost pushing De Guiche back into the courtyard again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that you, De Wardes?&mdash;What! and booted, spurred and whip in hand,
      too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The most befitting costume for a man about to set off for Le Havre. There
      will be no one left in Paris to-morrow." And hereupon he saluted Malicorne
      with great ceremony, whose handsome dress gave him the appearance of a
      prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. Malicorne," said De Guiche to his friend. De Wardes bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Wardes," said Guiche to Malicorne, who bowed in return. "By the by,
      De Wardes," continued De Guiche, "you who are so well acquainted with
      these matters, can you tell us, probably, what appointments are still
      vacant at the court; or rather in the prince's household?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the prince's household," said De Wardes looking up with an air of
      consideration, "let me see&mdash;the appointment of the master of the
      horse is vacant, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said Malicorne, "there is no question of such a post as that,
      monsieur; my ambition is not nearly so exalted."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes had a more penetrating observation than De Guiche, and fathomed
      Malicorne immediately. "The fact is," he said, looking at him from head to
      foot, "a man must be either a duke or a peer to fill that post."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I solicit," said Malicorne, "is a very humble appointment; I am of
      little importance, and I do not rank myself above my position."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. Malicorne, whom you see here," said De Guiche to De Wardes, "is a very
      excellent fellow, whose only misfortune is that of not being of gentle
      birth. As far as I am concerned, you know, I attach little value to those
      who have but gentle birth to boast of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assuredly," said De Wardes; "but will you allow me to remark, my dear
      count, that, without rank of some sort, one can hardly hope to belong to
      his royal highness's household?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," said the count, "court etiquette is absolute. The devil!&mdash;we
      never so much as gave it a thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! a sad misfortune for me, monsieur le comte," said Malicorne,
      changing color.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet not without remedy, I hope," returned De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The remedy is found easily enough," exclaimed De Wardes; "you can be
      created a gentleman. His Eminence, the Cardinal Mazarin, did nothing else
      from morning till night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, hush, De Wardes," said the count; "no jests of that kind; it ill
      becomes us to turn such matters into ridicule. Letters of nobility, it is
      true, are purchasable; but that is a sufficient misfortune without the
      nobles themselves laughing at it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word, De Guiche, you're quite a Puritan, as the English say."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the Vicomte de Bragelonne was announced by one of the
      servants in the courtyard, in precisely the same manner as he would have
      done in a room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, my dear Raoul. What! you, too, booted and spurred? You are
      setting off, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Bragelonne approached the group of young men, and saluted them with that
      quiet and serious manner peculiar to him. His salutation was principally
      addressed to De Wardes, with whom he was unacquainted, and whose features,
      on his perceiving Raoul, had assumed a strange sternness of expression. "I
      have come, De Guiche," he said, "to ask your companionship. We set off for
      Le Havre, I presume."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is admirable&mdash;delightful. We shall have a most enjoyable
      journey. M. Malicorne, M. Bragelonne&mdash;ah! M. de Wardes, let me
      present you." The young men saluted each other in a restrained manner.
      Their very natures seemed, from the beginning, disposed to take exception
      to each other. De Wardes was pliant, subtle, full of dissimulation; Raoul
      was calm, grave, and upright. "Decide between us&mdash;between De Wardes
      and myself, Raoul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon what subject?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon the subject of noble birth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can be better informed on that subject than a De Gramont?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No compliments; it is your opinion I ask."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least, inform me of the subject under discussion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "De Wardes asserts that the distribution of titles is abused; I, on the
      contrary, maintain that a title is useless to the man on whom it is
      bestowed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are correct," said Bragelonne, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, monsieur le vicomte," interrupted De Wardes, with a kind of
      obstinacy, "I affirm that it is I who am correct."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was your opinion, monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was saying that everything is done in France at the present moment, to
      humiliate men of family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And by whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the king himself. He surrounds himself with people who cannot show
      four quarterings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense," said De Guiche, "where could you possibly have seen that, De
      Wardes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One example will suffice," he returned, directing his look fully upon
      Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "State it then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know who has just been nominated captain-general of the
      musketeers?&mdash;an appointment more valuable than a peerage; for it
      gives precedence over all the marechals of France."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul's color mounted in his face; for he saw the object De Wardes had in
      view. "No; who has been appointed? In any case it must have been very
      recently, for the appointment was vacant eight days ago; a proof of which
      is, that the king refused Monsieur, who solicited the post for one of his
      <i>proteges</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the king refused it to Monsieur's <i>protege</i>, in order to
      bestow it upon the Chevalier d'Artagnan, a younger brother of some Gascon
      family, who has been trailing his sword in the ante-chambers during the
      last thirty years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me if I interrupt you," said Raoul, darting a glance full of
      severity at De Wardes; "but you give me the impression of being
      unacquainted with the gentleman of whom you are speaking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I not acquainted with M. d'Artagnan? Can you tell me, monsieur, who does
      <i>not</i> know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those who <i>do</i> know him, monsieur," replied Raoul, with still
      greater calmness and sternness of manner, "are in the habit of saying,
      that if he is not as good a gentleman as the king&mdash;which is not his
      fault&mdash;he is the equal of all the kings of the earth in courage and
      loyalty. Such is my opinion, monsieur; and I thank heaven I have known M.
      d'Artagnan from my birth."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes was about to reply, when De Guiche interrupted him.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Chapter VII. The Portrait of Madame.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The discussion was becoming full of bitterness. De Guiche perfectly
      understood the whole matter, for there was in Bragelonne's face a look
      instinctively hostile, while in that of De Wardes there was something like
      a determination to offend. Without inquiring into the different feelings
      which actuated his two friends, De Guiche resolved to ward off the blow
      which he felt was on the point of being dealt by one of them, and perhaps
      by both. "Gentlemen," he said, "we must take our leave of each other, I
      must pay a visit to Monsieur. You, De Wardes, will accompany me to the
      Louvre, and you, Raoul, will remain here master of the house; and as all
      that is done here is under your advice, you will bestow the last glance
      upon my preparations for departure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul, with the air of one who neither seeks nor fears a quarrel, bowed
      his head in token of assent, and seated himself upon a bench in the sun.
      "That is well," said De Guiche, "remain where you are, Raoul, and tell
      them to show you the two horses I have just purchased; you will give me
      your opinion, for I only bought them on condition that you ratified the
      purchase. By the by, I have to beg your pardon for having omitted to
      inquire after the Comte de la Fere." While pronouncing these latter words,
      he closely observed De Wardes, in order to perceive what effect the name
      of Raoul's father would produce upon him. "I thank you," answered the
      young man, "the count is very well." A gleam of deep hatred passed into De
      Wardes's eyes. De Guiche, who appeared not to notice the foreboding
      expression, went up to Raoul, and grasping him by the hand, said,&mdash;"It
      is agreed, then, Bragelonne, is it not, that you will rejoin us in the
      courtyard of the Palais Royal?" He then signed to De Wardes to follow him,
      who had been engaged in balancing himself first on one foot, then on the
      other. "We are going," said he, "come, M. Malicorne." This name made Raoul
      start; for it seemed that he had already heard it pronounced before, but
      he could not remember on what occasion. While trying to recall it
      half-dreamily, yet half-irritated at his conversation with De Wardes, the
      three young men set out on their way towards the Palais Royal, where
      Monsieur was residing. Malicorne learned two things; the first, that the
      young men had something to say to each other; and the second, that he
      ought not to walk in the same line with them; and therefore he walked
      behind. "Are you mad?" said De Guiche to his companion, as soon as they
      had left the Hotel de Grammont; "you attack M. d'Artagnan, and that, too,
      before Raoul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said De Wardes, "what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by 'what then?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, is there any prohibition against attacking M. d'Artagnan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you know very well that M. d'Artagnan was one of those celebrated and
      terrible four men who were called the musketeers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That they may be; but I do not perceive why, on that account, I should be
      forbidden to hate M. d'Artagnan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What cause has he given you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me! personally, none."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why hate him, therefore?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask my dead father that question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, my dear De Wardes, you surprise me. M. d'Artagnan is not one to
      leave unsettled any <i>enmity</i> he may have to arrange, without
      completely clearing his account. Your father, I have heard, carried
      matters with a high hand. Moreover, there are no enmities so bitter that
      they cannot be washed away by blood, by a good sword-thrust loyally
      given."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me, my dear De Guiche, this inveterate dislike existed between
      my father and M. d'Artagnan, and when I was quite a child, he acquainted
      me with the reason for it, and, as forming part of my inheritance, I
      regard it as a particular legacy bestowed upon me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And does this hatred concern M. d'Artagnan alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for that, M. d'Artagnan was so intimately associated with his three
      friends, that some portion of the full measure of my hatred falls to their
      lot, and that hatred is of such a nature, whenever the opportunity occurs,
      they shall have no occasion to complain of their allowance."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche had kept his eyes fixed on De Wardes, and shuddered at the
      bitter manner in which the young man smiled. Something like a presentiment
      flashed across his mind; he knew that the time had passed away for <i>grands
      coups entre gentilshommes</i>; but that the feeling of hatred treasured up
      in the mind, instead of being diffused abroad, was still hatred all the
      same; that a smile was sometimes as full of meaning as a threat; and, in a
      word, that to the fathers who had hated with their hearts and fought with
      their arms, would now succeed the sons, who would indeed hate with their
      hearts, but would no longer combat their enemies save by means of intrigue
      or treachery. As, therefore, it certainly was not Raoul whom he could
      suspect either of intrigue or treachery, it was on Raoul's account that De
      Guiche trembled. However, while these gloomy forebodings cast a shade of
      anxiety over De Guiche's countenance, De Wardes had resumed the entire
      mastery over himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events," he observed, "I have no personal ill-will towards M. de
      Bragelonne; I do not know him even."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In any case," said De Guiche, with a certain amount of severity in his
      tone of voice, "do not forget one circumstance, that Raoul is my most
      intimate friend;" a remark at which De Wardes bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation terminated there, although De Guiche tried his utmost to
      draw out his secret from him; but, doubtless, De Wardes had determined to
      say nothing further, and he remained impenetrable. De Guiche therefore
      promised himself a more satisfactory result with Raoul. In the meantime
      they had reached the Palais Royal, which was surrounded by a crowd of
      lookers-on. The household belonging to Monsieur awaited his command to
      mount their horses, in order to form part of the escort of the
      ambassadors, to whom had been intrusted the care of bringing the young
      princess to Paris. The brilliant display of horses, arms, and rich
      liveries, afforded some compensation in those times, thanks to the kindly
      feelings of the people, and to the traditions of deep devotion to their
      sovereigns, for the enormous expenses charged upon the taxes. Mazarin had
      said: "Let them sing, provided they pay;" while Louis XIV.'s remark was,
      "Let them look." Sight had replaced the voice; the people could still look
      but they were no longer allowed to sing. De Guiche left De Wardes and
      Malicorne at the bottom of the grand staircase, while he himself, who
      shared the favor and good graces of Monsieur with the Chevalier de
      Lorraine, who always smiled at him most affectionately, though he could
      not endure him, went straight to the prince's apartments, whom he found
      engaged in admiring himself in the glass, and rouging his face. In a
      corner of the cabinet, the Chevalier de Lorraine was extended full length
      upon some cushions, having just had his long hair curled, with which he
      was playing in the same manner a woman would have done. The prince turned
      round as the count entered, and perceiving who it was, said: "Ah! is that
      you, De Guiche; come here and tell me the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know, my lord, it is one of my defects to speak the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will hardly believe, De Guiche, how that wicked chevalier has annoyed
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The chevalier shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, he pretends," continued the prince, "that Mademoiselle Henrietta is
      better looking as a woman than I am as a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not forget, my lord," said De Guiche, frowning slightly, "you require
      me to speak the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said the prince, tremblingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and I shall tell it you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not be in a hurry, Guiche," exclaimed the prince, "you have plenty of
      time; look at me attentively, and try to recollect Madame. Besides, her
      portrait is here. Look at it." And he held out to him a miniature of the
      finest possible execution. De Guiche took it, and looked at it for a long
      time attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my honor, my lord, this is indeed a most lovely face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But look at me, count, look at me," said the prince, endeavoring to
      direct upon himself the attention of the count, who was completely
      absorbed in contemplation of the portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is wonderful," murmured Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really one would imagine you had never seen the young lady before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true, my lord, I have seen her but it was five years ago; there is
      a great difference between a child twelve years old, and a girl of
      seventeen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what is your opinion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My opinion is that the portrait must be flattering, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of that," said the prince triumphantly, "there can be no doubt; but let
      us suppose that it is not, what would your opinion be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, that your highness is exceedingly happy to have so charming a
      bride."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chevalier de Lorraine burst out laughing. The prince understood how
      severe towards himself this opinion of the Comte de Guiche was, and he
      looked somewhat displeased, saying, "My friends are not over indulgent."
      De Guiche looked at the portrait again, and, after lengthened
      contemplation, returned it with apparent unwillingness, saying, "Most
      decidedly, my lord, I should rather prefer to look ten times at your
      highness, than to look at Madame once again." It seemed as if the
      chevalier had detected some mystery in these words, which were
      incomprehensible to the prince, for he exclaimed: "Very well, get married
      yourself." Monsieur continued painting himself, and when he had finished,
      looked at the portrait again once more, turned to admire himself in the
      glass, and smiled, and no doubt was satisfied with the comparison. "You
      are very kind to have come," he said to Guiche, "I feared you would leave
      without bidding me adieu."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness knows me too well to believe me capable of so great a
      disrespect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides, I suppose you have something to ask from me before leaving
      Paris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness has indeed guessed correctly, for I have a request to
      make."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chevalier de Lorraine immediately displayed the greatest attention,
      for he regarded every favor conferred upon another as a robbery committed
      against himself. And, as Guiche hesitated, the prince said: "If it be
      money, nothing could be more fortunate, for I am in funds; the
      superintendent of the finances has sent me 500,000 pistoles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank your highness; but is not an affair of money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, then? Tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The appointment of a maid of honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! oh! Guiche, what a protector you have become of young ladies," said
      the prince, "you never speak of any one else now."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chevalier de Lorraine smiled, for he knew very well that nothing
      displeased the prince more than to show any interest in ladies. "My lord,"
      said the comte, "it is not I who am directly interested in the lady of
      whom I have just spoken; I am acting on behalf of one of my friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! that is different; what is the name of the young lady in whom your
      friend is so interested?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mlle. de la Baume le Blanc de la Valliere; she is already maid of honor
      to the dowager princess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, she is lame," said the Chevalier de Lorraine, stretching himself on
      his cushions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lame," repeated the prince, "and Madame to have her constantly before her
      eyes? Most certainly not; it may be dangerous for her when in an
      interesting condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chevalier de Lorraine burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chevalier," said Guiche, "your conduct is ungenerous; while I am
      soliciting a favor, you do me all the mischief you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, comte," said the Chevalier de Lorraine, somewhat uneasy at
      the tone in which Guiche had made his remark, "but I had no intention of
      doing so, and I begin to believe that I have mistaken one young lady for
      another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no doubt of it, monsieur; and I do not hesitate to declare that
      such is the case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you attach much importance to it, Guiche?" inquired the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you shall have it; but ask me for no more appointments, for there
      are none to give away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" exclaimed the chevalier, "midday already, that is the hour fixed for
      the departure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You dismiss me, monsieur?" inquired Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, count, you treat me very ill to-day," replied the chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For heaven's sake, count, for heaven's sake, chevalier," said Monsieur,
      "do you not see how you are distressing me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness's signature?" said Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take a blank appointment from that drawer, and give it to me." Guiche
      handed the prince the document indicated, and at the same time presented
      him with a pen already dipped in ink; whereupon the prince signed. "Here,"
      he said, returning him the appointment, "but I give it on one condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Name it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you make friends with the chevalier."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Willingly," said Guiche. And he held out his hand to the chevalier with
      an indifference amounting to contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adieu, count," said the chevalier, without seeming in any way to have
      noticed the count's slight; "adieu, and bring us back a princess who will
      not talk with her own portrait too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, set off and lose no time. By the by, who will accompany you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bragelonne and De Wardes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both excellent and fearless companions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too fearless," said the chevalier; "endeavor to bring them both back,
      count."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A bad heart, bad!" murmured De Guiche; "he scents mischief everywhere,
      and sooner than anything else." And taking leave of the prince, he quitted
      the apartment. As soon as he reached the vestibule, he waved in the air
      the paper which the prince had signed. Malicorne hurried forward, and
      received it, trembling with delight. When, however, he held in his hand,
      Guiche observed that he still awaited something further.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Patience, monsieur," he said; "the Chevalier de Lorraine was there, and I
      feared an utter failure if I asked too much at once. Wait until I return.
      Adieu."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adieu, monsieur le comte; a thousand thanks," said Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send Manicamp to me. By the way, monsieur, is it true that Mlle. de la
      Valliere is lame?" As he said this, he noticed that Bragelonne, who had
      just at that moment entered the courtyard, turned suddenly pale. The poor
      lover had heard the remark, which, however, was not the case with
      Malicorne, for he was already beyond the reach of the count's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why is Louise's name spoken of here," said Raoul to himself; "oh! let not
      De Wardes, who stands smiling yonder, even say a word about her in my
      presence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, gentlemen," exclaimed the Comte de Guiche, "prepare to start."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the prince, who had complete his toilette, appeared at the
      window, and was immediately saluted by the acclamations of all who
      composed the escort, and ten minutes afterwards, banners, scarfs, and
      feathers were fluttering and waving in the air, as the cavalcade galloped
      away.

    <h2>
      Chapter VIII. Le Havre.
    </h2>
    <p>
      This brilliant and animated company, the members of which were inspired by
      various feelings, arrived at Le Havre four days after their departure from
      Paris. It was about five o'clock in the afternoon, and no intelligence had
      yet been received of Madame. They were soon engaged in quest of
      apartments; but the greatest confusion immediately ensued among the
      masters, and violent quarrels among their attendants. In the midst of this
      disorder, the Comte de Guiche fancied he recognized Manicamp. It was,
      indeed, Manicamp himself; but as Malicorne had taken possession of his
      very best costume, he had not been able to get any other than a suit of
      violet velvet, trimmed with silver. Guiche recognized him as much by his
      dress as by his features, for he had very frequently seen Manicamp in his
      violet suit, which was his last resource. Manicamp presented himself to
      the count under an arch of torches, which set in a blaze, rather than
      illuminated, the gate by which Le Havre is entered, and which is situated
      close to the tower of Francis I. The count, remarking the woe-begone
      expression of Manicamp's face, could not resist laughing. "Well, my poor
      Manicamp," he exclaimed, "how violet you look; are you in mourning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied Manicamp; "I am in mourning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For whom, or for what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For my blue-and-gold suit, which has disappeared, and in the place of
      which I could find nothing but this; and I was even obliged to economize
      from compulsion, in order to get possession of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is singular you should be astonished at that, since you leave me
      without any money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events, here you are, and that is the principal thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the most horrible roads."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you lodging?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lodging?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not lodging anywhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche began to laugh. "Well," said he, "where do you intend to lodge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the same place you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't know, myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by saying you don't know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, how is it likely I should know where I should stay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you not retained an hotel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you or the prince."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither of us has thought of it. Le Havre is of considerable size, I
      suppose; and provided I can get a stable for a dozen horses, and a
      suitable house in a good quarter&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, there are some very excellent houses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by saying not for us?&mdash;for whom, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the English, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the English?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; the houses are all taken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the Duke of Buckingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon?" said Guiche, whose attention this name had awakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, by the Duke of Buckingham. His Grace was preceded by a courier, who
      arrived here three days ago, and immediately retained all the houses fit
      for habitation the town possesses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, Manicamp, let us understand each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what I have told you is clear enough, it seems to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely Buckingham does not occupy the whole of Le Havre?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He certainly does not occupy it, since he has not yet arrived; but, once
      disembarked, he will occupy it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! oh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is quite clear you are not acquainted with the English; they have a
      perfect rage for monopolizing everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may be; but a man who has the whole of one house, is satisfied with
      it, and does not require two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but two men?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so; for two men, two houses, or four or six, or ten, if you like;
      but there are a hundred houses at Le Havre."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and all the hundred are let."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What an obstinate fellow you are. I tell you Buckingham has hired all the
      houses surrounding the one which the queen dowager of England and the
      princess her daughter will inhabit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is singular enough, indeed," said De Wardes, caressing his horse's
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such is the case, however, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite sure of it, Monsieur de Manicamp?" and as he put this
      question, he looked slyly at De Guiche, as though to interrogate him upon
      the degree of confidence to be placed in his friend's state of mind.
      During this discussion the night had closed in, and the torches, pages,
      attendants, squires, horses, and carriages, blocked up the gate and the
      open place; the torches were reflected in the channel, which the rising
      tide was gradually filling, while on the other side of the jetty might be
      noticed groups of curious lookers-on, consisting of sailors and
      townspeople, who seemed anxious to miss nothing of the spectacle. Amidst
      all this hesitation of purpose, Bragelonne, as though a perfect stranger
      to the scene, remained on his horse somewhat in the rear of Guiche, and
      watched the rays of light reflected on the water, inhaling with rapture
      the sea breezes, and listening to the waves which noisily broke upon the
      shore and on the beach, tossing the spray into the air with a noise that
      echoed in the distance. "But," exclaimed De Guiche, "what is Buckingham's
      motive for providing such a supply of lodgings?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," said De Wardes; "what reason has he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very excellent one," replied Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know what it is, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell us, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bend your head down towards me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! may it not be spoken except in private?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall judge of that yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well." De Guiche bent down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love," said Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not understand you at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say rather, you cannot understand me yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Explain yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; it is quite certain, count, that his royal highness will be
      the most unfortunate of husbands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Duke of Buckingham&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a name of ill omen to the princes of the house of France."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so the duke is madly in love with Madame, so the rumor runs, and will
      have no one approach her but himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche colored. "Thank you, thank you," said he to Manicamp, grasping
      his hand. Then, recovering himself, added, "Whatever you do, Manicamp, be
      careful that this project of Buckingham's is not made known to any
      Frenchman here; for, if so, many a sword would be unsheathed in this
      country that does not fear English steel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But after all," said Manicamp, "I have had no satisfactory proof given me
      of the love in question, and it may be no more than an idle tale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said De Guiche, "it must be the truth;" and despite his command
      over himself, he clenched his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Manicamp, "after all, what does it matter to you? What does
      it matter to me whether the prince is to be what the late king was?
      Buckingham the father for the queen, Buckingham the son for the princess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Manicamp! Manicamp!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a fact, or at least, everybody says so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silence!" cried the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why, silence?" said De Wardes; "it is a highly creditable
      circumstance for the French nation. Are not you of my opinion, Monsieur de
      Bragelonne?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To what circumstance do you allude?" inquired De Bragelonne with an
      abstracted air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That the English should render homage to the beauty of our queens and our
      princesses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, but I have not been paying attention to what has passed; will
      you oblige me by explaining."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no doubt it was necessary that Buckingham the father should come
      to Paris in order that his majesty, King Louis XIII., should perceive that
      his wife was one of the most beautiful women of the French court; and it
      seems necessary, at the present time, that Buckingham the son should
      consecrate, by the devotion of his worship, the beauty of a princess who
      has French blood in her veins. The fact of having inspired a passion on
      the other side of the Channel will henceforth confer a title to beauty on
      this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," replied De Bragelonne, "I do not like to hear such matters treated
      so lightly. Gentlemen like ourselves should be careful guardians of the
      honor of our queens and our princesses. If we jest at them, what will our
      servants do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How am I to understand that?" said De Wardes, whose ears tingled at the
      remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In any way you chose, monsieur," replied De Bragelonne, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bragelonne, Bragelonne," murmured De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Wardes," exclaimed Manicamp, noticing that the young man had
      spurred his horse close to the side of Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen, gentlemen," said De Guiche, "do not set such an example in
      public, in the street too. De Wardes, you are wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wrong; in what way, may I ask you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are wrong, monsieur, because you are always speaking ill of someone
      or something," replied Raoul, with undisturbed composure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be indulgent, Raoul," said De Guiche, in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray do not think of fighting, gentlemen!" said Manicamp, "before you
      have rested yourselves; for in that case you will not be able to do much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come," said De Guiche, "forward, gentlemen!" and breaking through the
      horses and attendants, he cleared the way for himself towards the center
      of the square, through the crowd, followed by the whole cavalcade. A large
      gateway looking out upon a courtyard was open; Guiche entered the
      courtyard, and Bragelonne, De Wardes, Manicamp, and three or four other
      gentlemen, followed him. A sort of council of war was held, and the means
      to be employed for saving the dignity of the embassy were deliberated
      upon. Bragelonne was of the opinion that the right of priority should be
      respected, while De Wardes suggested that the town should be sacked. This
      latter proposition appearing to Manicamp rather premature, he proposed
      instead that they should first rest themselves. This was the wisest thing
      to do, but, unhappily, to follow his advice, two things were wanting;
      namely, a house and beds. De Guiche reflected for awhile, and then said
      aloud, "Let him who loves me, follow me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The attendants also?" inquired a page who had approached the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every one," exclaimed the impetuous young man. "Manicamp, show us the way
      to the house destined for her royal highness's residence."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without in any way divining the count's project, his friends followed him,
      accompanied by a crowd of people, whose acclamations and delight seemed a
      happy omen for the success of that project with which they were yet
      unacquainted. The wind was blowing strongly from the harbor, and moaning
      in fitful gusts.

    <h2>
      Chapter IX. At Sea.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following day was somewhat calmer, although the gale still continued.
      The sun had, however, risen through a bank of orange clouds, tingeing with
      its cheerful rays the crests of the black waves. Watch was impatiently
      kept from the different look-outs. Towards eleven o'clock in the morning a
      ship, with sails full set, was signalled as in view; two others followed
      at the distance of about half a knot. They approached like arrows shot
      from the bow of a skillful archer; and yet the sea ran so high that their
      speed was as nothing compared to the rolling of the billows in which the
      vessels were plunging first in one direction and then in another. The
      English fleet was soon recognized by the line of the ships, and by the
      color of their pennants; the one which had the princess on board and
      carried the admiral's flag preceded the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rumor now spread that the princess was arriving. The whole French
      court ran to the harbor, while the quays and jetties were soon covered by
      crowds of people. Two hours afterwards, the other vessels had overtaken
      the flagship, and the three, not venturing perhaps to enter the narrow
      entrance of the harbor, cast anchor between Le Havre and La Heve. When the
      maneuver had been completed, the vessel which bore the admiral saluted
      France by twelve discharges of cannon, which were returned, discharge for
      discharge, from Fort Francis I. Immediately afterwards a hundred boats
      were launched; they were covered with the richest stuffs, and destined for
      the conveyance of the different members of the French nobility towards the
      vessels at anchor. But when it was observed that even inside the harbor
      the boats were tossed to and fro, and that beyond the jetty the waves rose
      mountains high, dashing upon the shore with a terrible uproar, it was
      readily believed that not one of those frail boats would be able with
      safety to reach a fourth part of the distance between the shore and the
      vessels at anchor. A pilot-boat, however, notwithstanding the wind and the
      sea, was getting ready to leave the harbor, for the purpose of placing
      itself at the admiral's disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche, who had been looking among the different boats for one stronger
      than the others, which might offer a chance of reaching the English
      vessels, perceiving the pilot-boat getting ready to start, said to Raoul:
      "Do you not think, Raoul, that intelligent and vigorous men, as we are,
      ought to be ashamed to retreat before the brute strength of wind and
      waves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is precisely the very reflection I was silently making to myself,"
      replied Bragelonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we get into that boat, then, and push off? Will you come, De
      Wardes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, or you will get drowned," said Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for no purpose," said De Wardes, "for with the wind in your teeth, as
      it will be, you will never reach the vessels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You refuse, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assuredly I do; I would willingly risk and lose my life in an encounter
      against men," he said, glancing at Bragelonne, "but as to fighting with
      oars against waves, I have no taste for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for myself," said Manicamp, "even were I to succeed in reaching the
      ships, I should not be indifferent to the loss of the only good dress
      which I have left,&mdash;salt water would spoil it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, then, refuse also?" exclaimed De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Decidedly I do; I beg you to understand that most distinctly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," exclaimed De Guiche, "look, De Wardes&mdash;look, Manicamp&mdash;look
      yonder, the princesses are looking at us from the poop of the admiral's
      vessel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An additional reason, my dear fellow, why we should not make ourselves
      ridiculous by being drowned while they are looking on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that your last word, Manicamp?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then yours, De Wardes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I go alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so," said Raoul, "for I shall accompany you; I thought it was
      understood I should do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is, that Raoul, uninfluenced by devotion, measuring the risk they
      run, saw how imminent the danger was, but he willingly allowed himself to
      accept a peril which De Wardes had declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat was about to set off when De Guiche called to the pilot. "Stay,"
      said he: "we want two places in your boat;" and wrapping five or six
      pistoles in paper, he threw them from the quay into the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems you are not afraid of salt water, young gentlemen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are afraid of nothing," replied De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pilot approached the side of the boat, and the two young men, one
      after the other, with equal vivacity, jumped into the boat. "Courage, my
      men," said De Guiche; "I have twenty pistoles left in this purse, and as
      soon as we reach the admiral's vessel they shall be yours." The sailors
      bent themselves to their oars, and the boat bounded over the crest of the
      waves. The interest taken in this hazardous expedition was universal; the
      whole population of Le Havre hurried towards the jetties and every look
      was directed towards the little bark; at one moment it flew suspended on
      the crest of the foaming waves, then suddenly glided downwards towards the
      bottom of a raging abyss, where it seemed utterly lost. At the expiration
      of an hour's struggling with the waves, it reached the spot where the
      admiral's vessel was anchored, and from the side of which two boats had
      already been dispatched towards their aid. Upon the quarter-deck of the
      flagship, sheltered by a canopy of velvet and ermine, which was suspended
      by stout supports, Henriette, the queen dowager, and the young princess&mdash;with
      the admiral, the Duke of Norfolk, standing beside them&mdash;watched with
      alarm this slender bark, at one moment tossed to the heavens, and the next
      buried beneath the waves, and against whose dark sail the noble figures of
      the two French gentlemen stood forth in relief like two luminous
      apparitions. The crew, leaning against the bulwarks and clinging to the
      shrouds, cheered the courage of the two daring young men, the skill of the
      pilot, and the strength of the sailors. They were received at the side of
      the vessel by a shout of triumph. The Duke of Norfolk, a handsome young
      man, from twenty-six to twenty-eight years of age, advanced to meet them.
      De Guiche and Bragelonne lightly mounted the ladder on the starboard side,
      and, conducted by the Duke of Norfolk, who resumed his place near them,
      they approached to offer their homage to the princess. Respect, and yet
      more, a certain apprehension, for which he could not account, had hitherto
      restrained the Comte de Guiche from looking at Madame attentively, who,
      however, had observed him immediately, and had asked her mother, "Is not
      that Monsieur in the boat yonder?" Madame Henriette, who knew Monsieur
      better than her daughter did, smiled at the mistake her vanity had led her
      into, and had answered, "No; it is only M. de Guiche, his favorite." The
      princess, at this reply, was constrained to check an instinctive
      tenderness of feeling which the courage displayed by the count had
      awakened. At the very moment the princess had put this question to her
      mother, De Guiche had, at last, summoned courage to raise his eyes towards
      her and could compare the original with the portrait he had so lately
      seen. No sooner had he remarked her pale face, her eyes so full of
      animation, her beautiful nut-brown hair, her expressive lips, and her
      every gesture, which, while betokening royal descent, seemed to thank and
      to encourage him at one and the same time, than he was, for a moment, so
      overcome, that, had it not been for Raoul, on whose arm he leant, he would
      have fallen. His friend's amazed look, and the encouraging gesture of the
      queen, restored Guiche to his self-possession. In a few words he explained
      his mission, explained in what way he had become envoy of his royal
      highness; and saluted, according to their rank and the reception they gave
      him, the admiral and several of the English noblemen who were grouped
      around the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul was then presented, and was most graciously received; the share that
      the Comte de la Fere had had in the restoration of Charles II. was known
      to all; and, more than that, it was the comte who had been charged with
      the negotiation of the marriage, by means of which the granddaughter of
      Henry IV. was now returning to France. Raoul spoke English perfectly, and
      constituted himself his friend's interpreter with the young English
      noblemen, who were indifferently acquainted with the French language. At
      this moment, a young man came forward, of extremely handsome features, and
      whose dress and arms were remarkable for their extravagance of material.
      He approached the princesses, who were engaged in conversation with the
      Duke of Norfolk, and, in a voice which ill concealed his impatience, said,
      "It is now time to disembark, your royal highness." The younger of the
      princesses rose from her seat at this remark, and was about to take the
      hand which the young nobleman extended to her, with an eagerness which
      arose from a variety of motives, when the admiral intervened between them,
      observing: "A moment, if you please, my lord; it is not possible for
      ladies to disembark just now, the sea is too rough; it is probable the
      wind may abate before sunset, and the landing will not be effected,
      therefore, until this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allow me to observe, my lord," said Buckingham, with an irritation of
      manner which he did not seek to disguise, "you detain these ladies, and
      you have no right to do so. One of them, unhappily, now belongs to France,
      and you perceive that France claims them by the voice of her ambassadors;"
      and at the same moment he indicated Raoul and Guiche, whom he saluted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot suppose that these gentlemen intend to expose the lives of their
      royal highnesses," replied the admiral.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These gentlemen," retorted Buckingham, "arrived here safely,
      notwithstanding the wind; allow me to believe that the danger will not be
      greater for their royal highnesses when the wind will be in their favor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These envoys have shown how great their courage is," said the admiral.
      "You may have observed that there was a great number of persons on shore
      who did <i>not</i> venture to accompany them. Moreover, the desire which
      they had to show their respect with the least possible delay to Madame and
      her illustrious mother, induced them to brave the sea, which is very
      tempestuous to-day, even for sailors. These gentlemen, however, whom I
      recommend as an example for my officers to follow, can hardly be so for
      these ladies."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame glanced at the Comte de Guiche, and perceived that his face was
      burning with confusion. This look had escaped Buckingham, who had eyes for
      nothing but Norfolk, of whom he was evidently very jealous; he seemed
      anxious to remove the princesses from the deck of a vessel where the
      admiral reigned supreme. "In that case," returned Buckingham, "I appeal to
      Madame herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I, my lord," retorted the admiral, "I appeal to my own conscience,
      and to my own sense of responsibility. I have undertaken to convey Madame
      safe and sound to France, and I shall keep my promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, sir&mdash;" continued Buckingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, permit me to remind you that I command here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you aware what you are saying, my lord?" replied Buckingham,
      haughtily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly so; I therefore repeat it: I alone command here, all yield
      obedience to me; the sea and the winds, the ships and men too." This
      remark was made in a dignified and authoritative manner. Raoul observed
      its effect upon Buckingham, who trembled with anger from head to foot, and
      leaned against one of the poles of the tent to prevent himself falling;
      his eyes became suffused with blood, and the hand which he did not need
      for his support wandered towards the hilt of his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord," said the queen, "permit me to observe that I agree in every
      particular with the Duke of Norfolk; if the heavens, instead of being
      clouded as they are at the present moment, were perfectly serene and
      propitious, we can still afford to bestow a few hours upon the officer who
      has conducted us so successfully, and with such extreme attention, to the
      French coast, where he is to take leave of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham, instead of replying, seemed to seek counsel from the
      expression of Madame's face. She, however, half-concealed beneath the
      thick curtains of the velvet and gold which sheltered her, had not
      listened to the discussion, having been occupied in watching the Comte de
      Guiche, who was conversing with Raoul. This was a fresh misfortune for
      Buckingham, who fancied he perceived in Madame Henrietta's look a deeper
      feeling than that of curiosity. He withdrew, almost tottering in his gait,
      and nearly stumbled against the mainmast of the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The duke has not acquired a steady footing yet," said the queen-mother,
      in French, "and that may possibly be his reason for wishing to find
      himself on firm land again."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man overheard this remark, turned suddenly pale, and, letting
      his hands fall in great discouragement by his side, drew aside, mingling
      in one sigh his old affection and his new hatreds. The admiral, however,
      without taking any further notice of the duke's ill-humor, led the
      princesses into the quarter-deck cabin, where dinner had been served with
      a magnificence worthy in every respect of his guests. The admiral seated
      himself at the right hand of the princess, and placed the Comte de Guiche
      on her left. This was the place Buckingham usually occupied; and when he
      entered the cabin, how profound was his unhappiness to see himself
      banished by etiquette from the presence of his sovereign, to a position
      inferior to that which, by rank, he was entitled to. De Guiche, on the
      other hand, paler still perhaps from happiness, than his rival was from
      anger, seated himself tremblingly next to the princess, whose silken robe,
      as it lightly touched him, caused a tremor of mingled regret and happiness
      to pass through his whole frame. The repast finished, Buckingham darted
      forward to hand Madame Henrietta from the table; but this time it was De
      Guiche's turn to give the duke a lesson. "Have the goodness, my lord, from
      this moment," said he, "not to interpose between her royal highness and
      myself. From this moment, indeed, her royal highness belongs to France,
      and when she deigns to honor me by touching my hand it is the hand of
      Monsieur, the brother of the king of France, she touches."
    </p>
    <p>
      And saying this, he presented his hand to Madame Henrietta with such
      marked deference, and at the same time with a nobleness of mien so
      intrepid, that a murmur of admiration rose from the English, whilst a
      groan of despair escaped from Buckingham's lips. Raoul, who loved,
      comprehended it all. He fixed upon his friend one of those profound looks
      which a bosom friend or mother can alone extend, either as protector or
      guardian, over the one who is about to stray from the right path. Towards
      two o'clock in the afternoon the sun shone forth anew, the wind subsided,
      the sea became smooth as a crystal mirror, and the fog, which had shrouded
      the coast, disappeared like a veil withdrawn before it. The smiling hills
      of France appeared in full view, with their numerous white houses rendered
      more conspicuous by the bright green of the trees or the clear blue sky.

    <h2>
      Chapter X. The Tents.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The admiral, as we have seen, was determined to pay no further attention
      to Buckingham's threatening glances and fits of passion. In fact, from the
      moment they quitted England, he had gradually accustomed himself to his
      behavior. De Guiche had not yet in any way remarked the animosity which
      appeared to influence that young nobleman against him, but he felt,
      instinctively, that there could be no sympathy between himself and the
      favorite of Charles II. The queen-mother, with greater experience and
      calmer judgment, perceived the exact position of affairs, and, as she
      discerned its danger, was prepared to meet it, whenever the proper moment
      should arrive. Quiet had been everywhere restored, except in Buckingham's
      heart; he, in his impatience, addressed himself to the princess, in a low
      tone of voice: "For Heaven's sake, madame, I implore you to hasten your
      disembarkation. Do you not perceive how that insolent Duke of Norfolk is
      killing me with his attentions and devotions to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Henrietta heard this remark; she smiled, and without turning her head
      towards him, but giving only to the tone of her voice that inflection of
      gentle reproach, and languid impertinence, which women and princesses so
      well know how to assume, she murmured, "I have already hinted, my lord,
      that you must have taken leave of your senses."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a single detail escaped Raoul's attention; he heard both Buckingham's
      entreaty and the princess's reply; he remarked Buckingham retire, heard
      his deep sigh, and saw him pass a hand over his face. He understood
      everything, and trembled as he reflected on the position of affairs, and
      the state of the minds of those about him. At last the admiral, with
      studied delay, gave the last orders for the departure of the boats.
      Buckingham heard the directions given with such an exhibition of delight
      that a stranger would really imagine the young man's reason was affected.
      As the Duke of Norfolk gave his commands, a large boat or barge, decked
      with flags, and capable of holding about twenty rowers and fifteen
      passengers, was slowly lowered from the side of the admiral's vessel. The
      barge was carpeted with velvet and decorated with coverings embroidered
      with the arms of England, and with garlands of flowers; for, at that time,
      ornamentation was by no means forgotten in these political pageants. No
      sooner was this really royal boat afloat, and the rowers with oars
      uplifted, awaiting, like soldiers presenting arms, the embarkation of the
      princess, than Buckingham ran forward to the ladder in order to take his
      place. His progress was, however, arrested by the queen. "My lord," she
      said, "it is hardly becoming that you should allow my daughter and myself
      to land without having previously ascertained that our apartments are
      properly prepared. I beg your lordship to be good enough to precede us
      ashore, and to give directions that everything be in proper order on our
      arrival."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a fresh disappointment for the duke, and, still more so, since it
      was so unexpected. He hesitated, colored violently, but could not reply.
      He had thought he might be able to keep near Madame during the passage to
      the shore, and, by this means, to enjoy to the very last moment the brief
      period fortune still reserved for him. The order, however, was explicit;
      and the admiral, who heard it given, immediately called out, "Launch the
      ship's gig." His directions were executed with that celerity which
      distinguishes every maneuver on board a man-of-war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham, in utter hopelessness, cast a look of despair at the princess,
      of supplication towards the queen, and directed a glance full of anger
      towards the admiral. The princess pretended not to notice him, while the
      queen turned aside her head, and the admiral laughed outright, at the
      sound of which Buckingham seemed ready to spring upon him. The
      queen-mother rose, and with a tone of authority said, "Pray set off, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young duke hesitated, looked around him, and with a last effort,
      half-choked by contending emotions, said, "And you, gentlemen, M. de
      Guiche and M. de Bragelonne, do not you accompany me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche bowed and said, "Both M. de Bragelonne and myself await her
      majesty's orders; whatever the commands she imposes on us, we shall obey
      them." Saying this, he looked towards the princess, who cast down her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your grace will remember," said the queen, "that M. de Guiche is here to
      represent Monsieur; it is he who will do the honors of France, as you have
      done those of England; his presence cannot be dispensed with; besides, we
      owe him this slight favor for the courage he displayed in venturing to
      seek us in such a terrible stress of weather."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham opened his lips, as if he were about to speak, but, whether
      thoughts or expressions failed him, not a syllable escaped them, and
      turning away, as though out of his mind, he leapt from the vessel into the
      boat. The sailors were just in time to catch hold of him to steady
      themselves; for his weight and the rebound had almost upset the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His grace cannot be in his senses," said the admiral aloud to Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am uneasy on the Duke's account," replied Bragelonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the boat was advancing towards the shore, the duke kept his eyes
      immovably fixed on the admiral's ship, like a miser torn away from his
      coffers, or a mother separated from her child, about to be lead away to
      death. No one, however, acknowledged his signals, his frowns, or his
      pitiful gestures. In very anguish of mind, he sank down in the boat,
      burying his hands in his hair, whilst the boat, impelled by the exertions
      of the merry sailors, flew over the waves. On his arrival he was in such a
      state of apathy, that, had he not been received at the harbor by the
      messenger whom he had directed to precede him, he would hardly have had
      strength to ask his way. Having once, however, reached the house which had
      been set apart for him, he shut himself up, like Achilles in his tent. The
      barge bearing the princess quitted the admiral's vessel at the very moment
      Buckingham landed. It was followed by another boat filled with officers,
      courtiers, and zealous friends. Great numbers of the inhabitants of Le
      Havre, having embarked in fishing-cobles and boats of every description,
      set off to meet the royal barge. The cannon from the forts fired salutes,
      which were returned by the flagship and the two other vessels, and the
      flashes from the open mouths of the cannon floated in white fumes over the
      waves, and disappeared in the clear blue sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess landed at the decorated quay. Bands of gay music greeted her
      arrival, and accompanied her every step she took. During the time she was
      passing through the center of town, and treading beneath her delicate feet
      the richest carpets and the gayest flowers, which had been strewn upon the
      ground, De Guiche and Raoul, escaping from their English friends, hurried
      through the town and hastened rapidly towards the place intended for the
      residence of Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us hurry forward," said Raoul to De Guiche, "for if I read
      Buckingham's character aright, he will create some disturbance, when he
      learns the result of our deliberations of yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never fear," said De Guiche, "De Wardes is there, who is determination
      itself, while Manicamp is the very personification of the artless
      gentleness."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche was not, however, the less diligent on that account, and five
      minutes afterwards they were within sight of the Hotel de Ville. The first
      thing which struck them was the number of people assembled in the square.
      "Excellent," said De Guiche; "our apartments, I see, are prepared."
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, in front of the Hotel de Ville, upon the wide open space before
      it, eight tents had been raised, surmounted by the flags of France and
      England united. The hotel was surrounded by tents, as by a girdle of
      variegated colors; ten pages and a dozen mounted troopers, for an escort,
      mounted guard before the tents. It had a singularly curious effect, almost
      fairy-like in its appearance. These tents had been constructed during the
      night-time. Fitted up, within and without, with the richest materials that
      De Guiche had been able to procure in Le Havre, they completely encircled
      the Hotel de Ville. The only passage which led to the steps of the hotel,
      and which was not inclosed by the silken barricade, was guarded by two
      tents, resembling two pavilions, the doorways of both of which opened
      towards the entrance. These two tents were destined for De Guiche and
      Raoul; in whose absence they were intended to be occupied, that of De
      Guiche by De Wardes, and that of Raoul by Manicamp. Surrounding these two
      tents, and the six others, a hundred officers, gentlemen, and pages,
      dazzling in their display of silk and gold, thronged like bees buzzing
      about a hive. Every one of them, their swords by their sides, was ready to
      obey the slightest sign either of De Guiche or Bragelonne, the leaders of
      the embassy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very moment the two young men appeared at the end of one of the
      streets leading to the square, they perceived, crossing the square at full
      gallop, a young man on horseback, whose costume was of surprising
      richness. He pushed hastily thorough the crowd of curious lookers-on, and,
      at the sight of these unexpected erections, uttered a cry of anger and
      dismay. It was Buckingham, who had awakened from his stupor, in order to
      adorn himself with a costume perfectly dazzling from its beauty, and to
      await the arrival of the princess and the queen-mother at the Hotel de
      Ville. At the entrance to the tents, the soldiers barred his passage, and
      his further progress was arrested. Buckingham, hopelessly infuriated,
      raised his whip; but his arm was seized by a couple of officers. Of the
      two guardians of the tent, only one was there. De Wardes was in the
      interior of the Hotel de Ville, engaging in attending to the execution of
      some orders by De Guiche. At the noise made by Buckingham, Manicamp, who
      was indolently reclining upon the cushions at the doorway of one of the
      tents, rose with his usual indifference, and, perceiving that the
      disturbance continued, made his appearance from underneath the curtains.
      "What is the matter?" he said, in a gentle tone of voice, "and who is
      making this disturbance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened, that, at the moment he began to speak, silence had just
      been restored, and, although his voice was very soft and gentle in its
      touch, every one heard his question. Buckingham turned round, and looked
      at the tall thin figure, and the listless expression of countenance of his
      questioner. Probably the personal appearance of Manicamp, who was dressed
      very plainly, did not inspire him with much respect, for he replied
      disdainfully, "Who may you be, monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp, leaning on the arm of a gigantic trooper, as firm as the pillar
      of a cathedral, replied in his usual tranquil tone of voice,&mdash;"And <i>you</i>,
      monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, monsieur, am the Duke of Buckingham; I have hired all the houses which
      surround the Hotel de Ville, where I have business to transact; and as
      these houses are let, they belong to me, and, as I hired them in order to
      preserve the right of free access to the Hotel de Ville, you are not
      justified in preventing me passing to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who prevents you passing, monsieur?" inquired Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your sentinels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you wish to pass on horseback, and orders have been given to let
      only persons on foot pass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one has any right to give orders here, except myself," said
      Buckingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On what grounds?" inquired Manicamp, with his soft tone. "Will you do me
      the favor to explain this enigma to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, as I have already told you, I have hired all the houses looking
      on the square."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are very well aware of that, since nothing but the square itself has
      been left for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are mistaken, monsieur; the square belongs to me, as well as the
      houses in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, monsieur, but you are mistaken there. In <i>our</i> country,
      we say, the highway belongs to the king, therefore this square is his
      majesty's; and, consequently, as we are the king's ambassadors, the square
      belongs to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have already asked you who you are, monsieur," exclaimed Buckingham,
      exasperated at the coolness of his interlocutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name is Manicamp," replied the young man, in a voice whose tones were
      as harmonious and sweet as the notes of an Aeolian harp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and said, "When I hired
      these houses which surround the Hotel de Ville, the square was unoccupied;
      these barracks obstruct my sight; I hereby order them to be removed."
    </p>
    <p>
      A hoarse and angry murmur ran through the crowd of listeners at these
      words. De Guiche arrived at this moment; he pushed through the crowd which
      separated him from Buckingham, and, followed by Raoul, arrived on the
      scene of action from one side, just as De Wardes came up from the other.
      "Pardon me, my lord; but if you have any complaint to make, have the
      goodness to address it to me, inasmuch as it was I who supplied the plans
      for the construction of these tents."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moreover, I would beg you to observe, monsieur, that the term 'barrack'
      is a highly objectionable one!" added Manicamp, graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were saying, monsieur&mdash;" continued De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was saying, monsieur le comte," resumed Buckingham, in a tone of anger
      more marked than ever, although in some measure moderated by the presence
      of an equal, "I was saying that it is impossible these tents can remain
      where they are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Impossible!</i>" exclaimed De Guiche, "and why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I object to them."
    </p>
    <p>
      A movement of impatience escaped De Guiche, but a warning glance from
      Raoul restrained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should the less object to them, monsieur, on account of the abuse of
      priority you have permitted yourself to exercise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Abuse!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most assuredly. You commission a messenger, who hires in your name the
      whole of the town of Le Havre, without considering the members of the
      French court, who would be sure to arrive here to meet Madame. Your Grace
      will admit that this is hardly friendly conduct in the representative of a
      friendly nation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The right of possession belongs to him who is first on the ground."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in France, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not in France?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because France is a country where politeness is observed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which means?" exclaimed Buckingham, in so violent a manner that those who
      were present drew back, expecting an immediate collision.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which means, monsieur," replied De Guiche, now rather pale, "that I
      caused these tents to be raised as habitations for myself and my friends,
      as a shelter for the ambassadors of France, as the only place of refuge
      which your exactions have left us in the town; and that I and those who
      are with me, shall remain in them, at least, until an authority more
      powerful, and more supreme, than your own shall dismiss me from them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In other words, until we are ejected, as the lawyers say," observed
      Manicamp, blandly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know an authority, monsieur, which I trust is such as you will
      respect," said Buckingham, placing his hand on his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, and as the goddess of Discord, inflaming all minds, was
      about to direct their swords against each other, Raoul gently placed his
      hand on Buckingham's shoulder. "One word, my lord," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My right, my right, first of all," exclaimed the fiery young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is precisely upon that point I wish to have the honor of addressing a
      word to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, monsieur, but let your remarks be brief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One question is all I ask; you can hardly expect me to be briefer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak, monsieur, I am listening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you, or is the Duke of Orleans, going to marry the granddaughter of
      Henry IV.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" exclaimed Buckingham, retreating a few steps,
      bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have the goodness to answer me," persisted Raoul tranquilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to ridicule me, monsieur?" inquired Buckingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your question is a sufficient answer for me. You admit, then, that it is
      not you who are going to marry the princess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know it perfectly well, monsieur, I should imagine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, but your conduct has been such as to leave it not
      altogether certain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proceed, monsieur, what do you mean to convey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul approached the duke. "Are you aware, my lord," he said, lowering his
      voice, "that your extravagances very much resemble the excesses of
      jealousy? These jealous fits, with respect to any woman, are not becoming
      in one who is neither her lover nor her husband; and I am sure you will
      admit that my remark applies with still greater force, when the lady in
      question is a princess of the blood royal!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," exclaimed Buckingham, "do you mean to insult Madame
      Henrietta?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be careful, my lord," replied Bragelonne, coldly, "for it is you who
      insult her. A little while since, when on board the admiral's ship, you
      wearied the queen, and exhausted the admiral's patience. I was observing,
      my lord; and, at first, I concluded you were not in possession of your
      senses, but I have since surmised the real significance of your madness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur!" exclaimed Buckingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One moment more, for I have yet another word to add. I trust I am the
      only one of my companions who has guessed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you aware, monsieur," said Buckingham, trembling with mingled
      feelings of anger and uneasiness, "are you aware that you are holding
      language towards me which requires to be checked?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Weigh your words well, my lord," said Raoul, haughtily; "my nature is not
      such that its vivacities need checking; whilst you, on the contrary, are
      descended from a race whose passions are suspected by all true Frenchmen;
      I repeat, therefore, for the second time, be careful!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Careful of what, may I ask? Do you presume to threaten me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am the son of the Comte de la Fere, my lord, and I never threaten,
      because I strike first. Therefore, understand me well, the threat that I
      hold out to you is this&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham clenched his hands, but Raoul continued, as though he had not
      observed the gesture. "At the very first word, beyond the respect and
      deference due to her royal highness, which you permit yourself to use
      towards her,&mdash;be patient my lord, for I am perfectly so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Undoubtedly. So long as Madame remained on English territory, I held my
      peace; but from the very moment she stepped on French ground, and now that
      we have received her in the name of the prince, I warn you, that at the
      first mark of disrespect which you, in your insane attachment, exhibit
      towards the royal house of France, I shall have one of two courses to
      follow;&mdash;either I declare, in the presence of every one, the madness
      with which you are now affected, and I get you ignominiously ordered back
      to England; or if you prefer it, I will run my dagger through your throat
      in the presence of all here. This second alternative seems to me the least
      disagreeable, and I think I shall hold to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham had become paler than the lace collar around his neck. "M. de
      Bragelonne," he said, "is it, indeed, a gentleman who is speaking to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; only the gentleman is speaking to a madman. Get cured, my lord, and
      he will hold quite another language to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, M. de Bragelonne," murmured the duke, in a voice, half-choked, and
      putting his hand to his neck,&mdash;"Do you not see I am choking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If your death were to take place at this moment, my lord," replied Raoul,
      with unruffled composure, "I should, indeed, regard it as a great
      happiness, for this circumstance would prevent all kinds of evil remarks;
      not alone about yourself, but also about those illustrious persons whom
      your devotion is compromising in so absurd a manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, you are right," said the young man, almost beside himself.
      "Yes, yes; better to die, than to suffer as I do at this moment." And he
      grasped a beautiful dagger, the handle of which was inlaid with precious
      stones; and which he half drew from his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul thrust his hand aside. "Be careful what you do," he said; "if you do
      not kill yourself, you commit a ridiculous action; and if you were to kill
      yourself, you sprinkle blood upon the nuptial robe of the princess of
      England."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham remained a minute gasping for breath; during this interval, his
      lips quivered, his fingers worked convulsively, and his eyes wandered, as
      though in delirium. Then suddenly, he said, "M. de Bragelonne, I know
      nowhere a nobler mind than yours; you are, indeed, a worthy son of the
      most perfect gentleman that ever lived. Keep your tents." And he threw his
      arms round Raoul's neck. All who were present, astounded at this conduct,
      which was the very reverse of what was expected, considering the violence
      of the one adversary and the determination of the other, began immediately
      to clap their hands, and a thousand cheers and joyful shouts arose from
      all sides. De Guiche, in his turn, embraced Buckingham somewhat against
      his inclination; but, at all events, he did embrace him. This was the
      signal for French and English to do the same; and they who, until that
      moment, had looked at each other with restless uncertainty, fraternized on
      the spot. In the meantime, the procession of the princess arrived, and had
      it not been for Bragelonne, two armies would have been engaged together in
      conflict, and blood would have been shed upon the flowers with which the
      ground was covered. At the appearance, however, of the banners borne at
      the head of the procession, complete order was restored.

    <h2>
      Chapter XI. Night.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Concord returned to its place amidst the tents. English and French rivaled
      each other in their devotion and courteous attention to the illustrious
      travelers. The English forwarded to the French baskets of flowers, of
      which they had made a plentiful provision to greet the arrival of the
      young princess; the French in return invited the English to a supper,
      which was to be given the next day. Congratulations were poured in upon
      the princess everywhere during her journey. From the respect paid her on
      all sides, she seemed like a queen; and from the adoration with which she
      was treated by two or three; she appeared an object of worship. The
      queen-mother gave the French the most affectionate reception. France was
      her native country, and she had suffered too much unhappiness in England
      for England to have made her forget France. She taught her daughter, then,
      by her own affection for it, that love for a country where they had both
      been hospitably received, and where a brilliant future opened before them.
      After the public entry was over, and the spectators in the streets had
      partially dispersed, and the sound of the music and cheering of the crowd
      could be heard only in the distance; when the night had closed in,
      wrapping with its star-covered mantle the sea, the harbor, the town, and
      surrounding country, De Guiche, still excited by the great events of the
      day, returned to his tent, and seated himself upon one of the stools with
      so profound an expression of distress that Bragelonne kept his eyes fixed
      upon him, until he heard him sigh, and then he approached him. The count
      had thrown himself back on his seat, leaning his shoulders against the
      partition of the tent, and remained thus, his face buried in his hands,
      with heaving chest and restless limbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are suffering?" asked Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cruelly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bodily, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; bodily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This has indeed been a harassing day," continued the young man, his eyes
      fixed upon his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; a night's rest will probably restore me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I leave you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I wish to talk to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall not speak to me, Guiche, until you have first answered my
      questions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proceed then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be frank with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you imagine why Buckingham has been so violent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suspect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because he is in love with Madame, is it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One could almost swear to it, to observe him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are mistaken; there is nothing of the kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is you who are mistaken, Raoul; I have read his distress in his eyes,
      in his every gesture and action the whole day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a poet, my dear count, and find subjects for your muse
      everywhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can perceive love clearly enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where it does not exist?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, where it does exist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not think you are deceiving yourself, Guiche?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am convinced of what I say," said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, inform me, count," said Raoul, fixing a penetrating look upon him,
      "what happened to render you so clear-sighted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Guiche hesitated for a moment, and then answered, "Self-love, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Self-love is a pedantic word, Guiche."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that, generally, you are less out of spirits than seems to be the
      case this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am fatigued."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me, Guiche; we have been campaigners together; we have been on
      horseback for eighteen hours at a time, and our horses dying from
      exhaustion, or hunger, have fallen beneath us, and yet we have laughed at
      our mishaps. Believe me, it is not fatigue that saddens you to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is annoyance, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What annoyance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That of this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The mad conduct of the Duke of Buckingham, do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course; is it not vexations for us, the representatives of our
      sovereign master, to witness the devotion of an Englishman to our future
      mistress, the second lady in point of rank in the kingdom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you are right; but I do not think any danger is to be apprehended
      from Buckingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; still he is intrusive. Did he not, on his arrival here, almost
      succeed in creating a disturbance between the English and ourselves; and,
      had it not been for you, for your admirable presence, for your singular
      decision of character, swords would have been drawn in the very streets of
      the town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You observe, however, that he has changed his tactics."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, certainly; but this is the very thing that amazes me so much. You
      spoke to him in a low tone of voice, what did you say to him? You think he
      loves her; you admit that such a passion does not give way readily. He
      does not love her, then!" De Guiche pronounced the latter with so marked
      an expression that Raoul raised his head. The noble character of the young
      man's countenance expressed a displeasure which could easily be read.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I said to him, count," replied Raoul, "I will repeat to you. Listen
      to me. I said, 'You are regarding with wistful feelings, and most
      injurious desire, the sister of your prince,&mdash;her to whom you are not
      affianced, who is not, who can never be anything to you; you are outraging
      those who, like ourselves, have come to seek a young lady to escort her to
      her husband.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You spoke to him in that manner?" asked Guiche, coloring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In those very terms; I even added more. 'How would you regard us,' I
      said, 'if you were to perceive among us a man mad enough, disloyal enough,
      to entertain other than sentiments of the most perfect respect for a
      princess who is the destined wife of our master?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      These words were so applicable to De Guiche that he turned pale, and,
      overcome by a sudden agitation, was barely able to stretch out one hand
      mechanically towards Raoul, as he covered his eyes and face with the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," continued Raoul, not interrupted by this movement of his friend,
      "Heaven be praised, the French, who are pronounced to be thoughtless and
      indiscreet, reckless, even, are capable of bringing a calm and sound
      judgment to bear on matters of such high importance. I added even more,
      for I said, 'Learn, my lord, that we gentlemen of France devote ourselves
      to our sovereigns by sacrificing them our affections, as well as our
      fortunes and our lives; and whenever it may chance to happen that the
      tempter suggests one of those vile thoughts that set the heart on fire, we
      extinguish the flame, even if it has to be done by shedding our blood for
      the purpose. Thus it is that the honor of three is saved: our country's,
      our master's, and our own. It is thus that we act, your Grace; it is thus
      that every man of honor ought to act.' In this manner, my dear Guiche,"
      continued Bragelonne, "I addressed the Duke of Buckingham; and he admitted
      I was right, and resigned himself unresistingly to my arguments."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche, who had hitherto sat leaning forward while Raoul was speaking,
      drew himself up, his eyes glancing proudly; he seized Raoul's hand, his
      face, which had been as cold as ice, seemed on fire. "And you spoke
      magnificently," he said, in a half-choked voice; "you are indeed a friend,
      Raoul. But now, I entreat you, leave me to myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you wish it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I need repose. Many things have agitated me to-day, both in mind and
      body; when you return to-morrow I shall no longer be the same man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I leave you, then," said Raoul, as he withdrew. The count advanced a step
      towards his friend, and pressed him warmly in his arms. But in this
      friendly pressure Raoul could detect the nervous agitation of a great
      internal conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was clear, starlit, and splendid; the tempest had passed away,
      and the sweet influences of the evening had restored life, peace and
      security everywhere. A few fleecy clouds were floating in the heavens, and
      indicated from their appearance a continuance of beautiful weather,
      tempered by a gentle breeze from the east. Upon the large square in front
      of the hotel, the shadows of the tents, intersected by the golden
      moonbeams, formed as it were a huge mosaic of jet and yellow flagstones.
      Soon, however, the entire town was wrapped in slumber; a feeble light
      still glimmered in Madame's apartment, which looked out upon the square,
      and the soft rays from the expiring lamp seemed to be the image of the
      calm sleep of a young girl, hardly yet sensible of life's anxieties, and
      in whom the flame of existence sinks placidly as sleep steals over the
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bragelonne quitted the tent with the slow and measured step of a man
      curious to observe, but anxious not to be seen. Sheltered behind the thick
      curtains of his own tent, embracing with a glance the whole square, he
      noticed that, after a few moments' pause, the curtains of De Guiche's tent
      were agitated, and then drawn partially aside. Behind them he could
      perceive the shadow of De Guiche, his eyes, glittering in the obscurity,
      fastened ardently upon the princess's sitting apartment, which was
      partially lighted by the lamp in the inner room. The soft light which
      illumined the windows was the count's star. The fervent aspirations of his
      nature could be read in his eyes. Raoul, concealed in the shadow, divined
      the many passionate thoughts that established, between the tent of the
      young ambassador and the balcony of the princess, a mysterious and magical
      bond of sympathy&mdash;a bond created by thoughts imprinted with so much
      strength and persistence of will, that they must have caused happy and
      loving dreams to alight upon the perfumed couch, which the count, with the
      eyes of his soul, devoured so eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But De Guiche and Raoul were not the only watchers. The window of one of
      the houses looking on the square was opened too, the casement of the house
      where Buckingham resided. By the aid of the rays of light which issued
      from this latter, the profile of the duke could be distinctly seen, as he
      indolently reclined upon the carved balcony with its velvet hangings; he
      also was breathing in the direction of the princess's apartment his
      prayers and the wild visions of his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul could not resist smiling, as thinking of Madame, he said to himself,
      "Hers is, indeed, a heart well besieged;" and then added, compassionately,
      as he thought of Monsieur, "and he is a husband well threatened too; it is
      a good thing for him that he is a prince of such high rank, that he has an
      army to safeguard for him that which is his own." Bragelonne watched for
      some time the conduct of the two lovers, listened to the loud and uncivil
      slumbers of Manicamp, who snored as imperiously as though he was wearing
      his blue and gold, instead of his violet suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned towards the night breeze which bore towards him, he seemed
      to think, the distant song of the nightingale; and, after having laid in a
      due provision of melancholy, another nocturnal malady, he retired to rest
      thinking, with regard to his own love affair, that perhaps four or even a
      larger number of eyes, quite as ardent as those of De Guiche and
      Buckingham, were coveting his own idol in the chateau at Blois. "And
      Mademoiselle de Montalais is by no means a very conscientious garrison,"
      said he to himself, sighing aloud.

    <h2>
      Chapter XII. From Le Havre to Paris.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next day the <i>fetes</i> took place, accompanied by all the pomp and
      animation that the resources of the town and the cheerful disposition of
      men's minds could supply. During the last few hours spent in Le Havre,
      every preparation for the departure had been made. After Madame had taken
      leave of the English fleet, and, once again, had saluted the country in
      saluting its flags, she entered her carriage, surrounded by a brilliant
      escort. De Guiche had hoped that the Duke of Buckingham would accompany
      the admiral to England; but Buckingham succeeded in demonstrating to the
      queen that there would be great impropriety in allowing Madame to proceed
      to Paris, almost unprotected. As soon as it had been settled that
      Buckingham was to accompany Madame, the young duke selected a corps of
      gentlemen and officers to form part of his own suite, so that it was
      almost an army that now set out towards Paris, scattering gold, and
      exciting the liveliest demonstrations as they passed through the different
      towns and villages on the route. The weather was very fine. France is a
      beautiful country, especially along the route by which the procession
      passed. Spring cast its flowers and its perfumed foliage on their path.
      Normandy, with its vast variety of vegetation, its blue skies and silver
      rivers, displayed itself in all the loveliness of a paradise to the new
      sister of the king. <i>Fetes</i> and brilliant displays received them
      everywhere along the line of march. De Guiche and Buckingham forgot
      everything; De Guiche in his anxiety to prevent any fresh attempts on the
      part of the duke, and Buckingham, in his desire to awaken in the heart of
      the princess a softer remembrance of the country to which the recollection
      of many happy days belonged. But, alas! the poor duke could perceive that
      the image of that country so cherished by himself became, from day to day,
      more and more effaced in Madame's mind, in exact proportion as her
      affection for France became more deeply engraved on her heart. In fact, it
      was not difficult to perceive that his most devoted attention awakened no
      acknowledgement, and that the grace with which he rode one of his most
      fiery horses was thrown away, for it was only casually and by the merest
      accident that the princess's eyes were turned towards him. In vain did he
      try, in order to fix upon himself one of those looks, which were thrown
      carelessly around, or bestowed elsewhere, to produce in the animal he rode
      its greatest display of strength, speed, temper and address; in vain did
      he, by exciting his horse almost to madness, spur him, at the risk of
      dashing himself in pieces against the trees, or of rolling in the ditches,
      over the gates and barriers which they passed, or down the steep
      declivities of the hills. Madame, whose attention had been aroused by the
      noise, turned her head for a moment to observe the cause of it, and then,
      slightly smiling, again entered into conversation with her faithful
      guardians, Raoul and De Guiche, who were quietly riding at her carriage
      doors. Buckingham felt himself a prey to all the tortures of jealousy; an
      unknown, unheard of anguish glided through his veins, and laid siege to
      his heart; and then, as if to show that he knew the folly of his conduct,
      and that he wished to correct, by the humblest submission, his flights of
      absurdity, he mastered his horse, and compelled him, reeking with sweat
      and flecked with foam, to champ his bit close beside the carriage, amidst
      the crowd of courtiers. Occasionally he obtained a word from Madame as a
      recompense, and yet her speech seemed almost a reproach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is well, my lord," she said, "now you are reasonable."
    </p>
    <p>
      Or from Raoul, "Your Grace is killing your horse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham listened patiently to Raoul's remarks, for he instinctively
      felt, without having had any proof that such was the case, that Raoul
      checked the display of De Guiche's feelings, and that, had it not been for
      Raoul, some mad act or proceeding, either of the count, or of Buckingham
      himself, would have brought about an open rupture, or a disturbance&mdash;perhaps
      even exile itself. From the moment of that excited conversation the two
      young men had held in front of the tents at Le Havre, when Raoul made the
      duke perceive the impropriety of his conduct, Buckingham felt himself
      attracted towards Raoul almost in spite of himself. He often entered into
      conversation with him, and it was nearly always to talk to him either of
      his father or of D'Artagnan, their mutual friend, in whose praise
      Buckingham was nearly as enthusiastic as Raoul. Raoul endeavored, as much
      as possible, to make the conversation turn upon this subject in De
      Wardes's presence, who had, during the whole journey, been exceedingly
      annoyed at the superior position taken by Bragelonne, and especially by
      his influence over De Guiche. De Wardes had that keen and merciless
      penetration most evil natures possess; he had immediately remarked De
      Guiche's melancholy, and divined the nature of his regard for the
      princess. Instead, however, of treating the subject with the same reserve
      which Raoul practiced; instead of regarding with that respect, which was
      their due, the obligations and duties of society, De Wardes resolutely
      attacked in the count the ever-sounding chord of juvenile audacity and
      pride. It happened one evening, during a halt at Mantes, that while De
      Guiche and De Wardes were leaning against a barrier, engaged in
      conversation, Buckingham and Raoul were also talking together as they
      walked up and down. Manicamp was engaged in devoted attendance on the
      princess, who already treated him without reserve, on account of his
      versatile fancy, his frank courtesy of manner, and conciliatory
      disposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confess," said De Wardes, "that you are really ill, and that your
      pedagogue of a friend has not succeeded in curing you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not understand you," said the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet it is easy enough; you are dying of love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are mad, De Wardes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madness it would be, I admit, if Madame were really indifferent to your
      martyrdom; but she takes so much notice of it, observes it to such an
      extent, that she compromises herself, and I tremble lest, on our arrival
      at Paris, M. de Bragelonne may not denounce both of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For shame, De Wardes, again attacking De Bragelonne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, a truce to child's play," replied the count's evil genius, in
      an undertone; "you know as well as I do what I mean. Besides, you must
      have observed how the princess's glance softens as she looks at you;&mdash;you
      can tell, by the very inflection of her voice, what pleasure she takes in
      listening to you, and can feel how thoroughly she appreciates the verses
      you recite to her. You cannot deny, too, that every morning she tells you
      how indifferently she slept the previous night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True, De Wardes, quite true; but what good is there in your telling me
      all that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not important to know the exact position of affairs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; not when I am a witness of things that are enough to drive one
      mad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay, stay," said De Wardes; "look, she calls you,&mdash;do you
      understand? Profit by the occasion, while your pedagogue is absent."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche could not resist; an invincible attraction drew him towards the
      princess. De Wardes smiled as he saw him withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are mistaken, monsieur," said Raoul, suddenly stepping across the
      barrier against which the previous moment the two friends had been
      leaning. "The pedagogue is here, and has overheard you."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes, at the sound of Raoul's voice, which he recognized without
      having occasion to look at him, half drew his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put up your sword," said Raoul; "you know perfectly well that, until our
      journey is at an end, every demonstration of that nature is useless. Why
      do you distill into the heart of the man you term your friend all the
      bitterness that infects your own? As regards myself, you wish to arouse a
      feeling of deep dislike against a man of honor&mdash;my father's friend
      and my own; and as for the count you wish him to love one who is destined
      for your master. Really, monsieur, I should regard you as a coward, and a
      traitor too, if I did not, with greater justice, regard you as a madman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," exclaimed De Wardes, exasperated, "I was deceived, I find, in
      terming you a pedagogue. The tone you assume, and the style which is
      peculiarly your own, is that of a Jesuit, and not of a gentleman.
      Discontinue, I beg, whenever I am present, this style I complain of, and
      the tone also. I hate M. d'Artagnan, because he was guilty of a cowardly
      act towards my father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lie, monsieur," said Raoul, coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You give me the lie, monsieur?" exclaimed De Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not, if what you assert is untrue?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You give me the lie, and will not draw your sword?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have resolved, monsieur, not to kill you until Madame shall have been
      delivered safely into her husband's hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kill me! Believe me, monsieur, your schoolmaster's rod does not kill so
      easily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Raoul, sternly, "but M. d'Artagnan's sword kills; and, not
      only do I possess his sword, but he has himself taught me how to use it;
      and with that sword, when a befitting time arrives, I will avenge his name&mdash;a
      name you have dishonored."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, monsieur," exclaimed De Wardes; "if you do not immediately
      give me satisfaction, I will avail myself of every means to revenge
      myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, monsieur," said Buckingham, suddenly, appearing upon the scene of
      action, "that is a threat which savors of assassination, and therefore,
      ill becomes a gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you say, my lord?" said De Wardes, turning round towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said, monsieur, that the words you have just spoken are displeasing to
      my English ears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, monsieur, if what you say is true," exclaimed De Wardes,
      thoroughly incensed, "I at least find in you one who will not escape me.
      Understand my words as you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take them in the manner they cannot but be understood," replied
      Buckingham, with that haughty tone which characterized him, and which,
      even in ordinary conversation, gave a tone of defiance to everything he
      said; "M. de Bragelonne is my friend, you insult M. de Bragelonne, and you
      shall give me satisfaction for that insult."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes cast a look upon De Bragelonne, who, faithful to the character
      he had assumed, remained calm and unmoved, even after the duke's defiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would seem that I did not insult M. de Bragelonne, since M. de
      Bragelonne, who carries a sword by his side, does not consider himself
      insulted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events you insult someone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I insulted M. d'Artagnan," resumed De Wardes, who had observed that
      this was the only means of stinging Raoul, so as to awaken his anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That, then," said Buckingham, "is another matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely so," said De Wardes; "it is the province of M. d'Artagnan's
      friends to defend him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am entirely of your opinion," replied the duke, who had regained all
      his indifference of manner; "if M. de Bragelonne were offended, I could
      not reasonably be expected to espouse his quarrel, since he is himself
      here; but when you say that it is a quarrel of M. d'Artagnan&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will of course leave me to deal with the matter," said De Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, on the contrary, for I draw my sword," said Buckingham, unsheathing
      it as he spoke; "for if M. d'Artagnan injured your father, he rendered, or
      at least did all that he could to render, a great service to mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes was thunderstruck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. d'Artagnan," continued Buckingham, "is the bravest gentleman I know. I
      shall be delighted, as I owe him many personal obligations, to settle them
      with you, by crossing my sword with yours." At the same moment Buckingham
      drew his sword from its scabbard, saluted Raoul, and put himself on guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes advanced a step to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay, gentlemen," said Raoul, advancing towards them, and placing his own
      drawn sword between the combatants, "the affair is hardly worth the
      trouble of blood being shed almost in the presence of the princess. M. de
      Wardes speaks ill of M. d'Artagnan, with whom he is not even acquainted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, monsieur," said De Wardes, setting his teeth hard together, and
      resting the point of his sword on the toe of his boot, "do you assert that
      I do not know M. d'Artagnan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not; you do not know him," replied Raoul, coldly, "and you are
      even not aware where he is to be found."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not know where he is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such must be the case, since you fix your quarrel with him upon
      strangers, instead of seeking M. d'Artagnan where he is to be found." De
      Wardes turned pale. "Well, monsieur," continued Raoul, "I will tell you
      where M. d'Artagnan is: he is now in Paris; when on duty he is to be met
      with at the Louvre,&mdash;when not on duty, in the Rue des Lombards. M.
      d'Artagnan can easily be discovered at either of those two places. Having,
      therefore, as you assert, so many causes of complaint against him, show
      your courage in seeking him out, and afford him an opportunity of giving
      you that satisfaction you seem to ask of every one but of himself." De
      Wardes passed his hand across his forehead, which was covered with
      perspiration. "For shame, M. de Wardes! so quarrelsome a disposition is
      hardly becoming after the publication of the edicts against duels. Pray
      think of that; the king will be incensed at our disobedience, particularly
      at such a time,&mdash;and his majesty will be in the right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuses," murmured De Wardes; "mere pretexts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, M. De Wardes," resumed Raoul, "such remarks are the idlest
      bluster. You know very well that the Duke of Buckingham is a man of
      undoubted courage, who has already fought ten duels, and will probably
      fight eleven. His name alone is significant enough. As far as I am
      concerned, you are well aware that I can fight also. I fought at Lens, at
      Bleneau, at the Dunes in front of the artillery, a hundred paces in front
      of the line, while you&mdash;I say this parenthetically&mdash;were a
      hundred paces behind it. True it is, that on that occasion there was far
      too great a concourse of persons present for your courage to be observed,
      and on that account perhaps you did not reveal it; while here, it would be
      a display, and would excite remark&mdash;you wish that others should talk
      about you, in what manner you do not care. Do not depend upon me, M. de
      Wardes to assist you in your designs, for I shall certainly not afford you
      that pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sensibly observed," said Buckingham, putting up his sword, "and I ask
      your forgiveness, M. de Bragelonne, for having allowed myself to yield to
      a first impulse."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes, however, on the contrary, perfectly furious, bounded forward
      and raised his sword, threateningly, against Raoul, who had scarcely
      enough time to put himself in a posture of defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, monsieur," said Bragelonne, tranquilly, "or you will put out
      one of my eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not fight, then?" said De Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at this moment; but this I promise to do; immediately on our arrival
      at Paris I will conduct you to M. d'Artagnan, to whom you shall detail all
      the causes of complaint you have against him. M d'Artagnan will solicit
      the king's permission to measure swords with you. The king will yield his
      consent, and when you shall have received the sword-thrust in due course,
      you will consider, in a calmer frame of mind, the precepts of the Gospel,
      which enjoin forgetfulness of injuries."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" exclaimed De Wardes, furious at this imperturbable coolness, "one
      can clearly see you are half a bastard, M. de Bragelonne."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul became as pale as death; his eyes flashed lightning, causing De
      Wardes involuntarily to fall back. Buckingham, also, who had perceived
      their expression, threw himself between the two adversaries, whom he had
      expected to see precipitate themselves on each other. De Wardes had
      reserved this injury for the last; he clasped his sword firmly in his
      hand, and awaited the encounter. "You are right, monsieur," said Raoul,
      mastering his emotion, "I am only acquainted with my father's name; but I
      know too well that the Comte de la Fere is too upright and honorable a man
      to allow me to fear for a single moment that there is, as you insinuate,
      any stain upon my birth. My ignorance, therefore, of my mother's name is a
      misfortune for me, and not a reproach. You are deficient in loyalty of
      conduct; you are wanting in courtesy, in reproaching me with misfortune.
      It matters little, however, the insult has been given, and I consider
      myself insulted accordingly. It is quite understood, then, that after you
      shall have received satisfaction from M. d'Artagnan, you will settle your
      quarrel with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I admire your prudence, monsieur," replied De Wardes with a bitter smile;
      "a little while ago you promised me a sword-thrust from M. d'Artagnan, and
      now, after I shall have received his, you offer me one from yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not disturb yourself," replied Raoul, with concentrated anger; "in all
      affairs of that nature, M. d'Artagnan is exceedingly skillful, and I will
      beg him as a favor to treat you as he did your father; in other words, to
      spare your life at least, so as to leave me the pleasure, after your
      recovery, of killing you outright; for you have the heart of a viper, M.
      de Wardes, and in very truth, too many precautions cannot be taken against
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall take my precautions against you," said De Wardes, "be assured of
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allow me, monsieur," said Buckingham, "to translate your remark by a
      piece of advice I am about to give M. de Bragelonne; M. de Bragelonne,
      wear a cuirass."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes clenched his hands. "Ah!" said he, "you two gentlemen intend to
      wait until you have taken that precaution before you measure your swords
      against mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, monsieur," said Raoul, "since you positively will have it so,
      let us settle the affair now." And, drawing his sword, he advanced towards
      De Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do?" said Buckingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be easy," said Raoul, "it will not be very long."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes placed himself on his guard; their swords crossed. De Wardes
      flew upon Raoul with such impetuosity, that at the first clashing of the
      steel blades Buckingham clearly saw that Raoul was only trifling with his
      adversary. Buckingham stepped aside, and watched the combat. Raoul was as
      calm as if he were handling a foil instead of a sword; having retreated a
      step, he parried three or four fierce thrusts which De Wardes made at him,
      caught the sword of the latter with within his own, and sent it flying
      twenty paces the other side of the barrier. Then as De Wardes stood
      disarmed and astounded at his defeat, Raoul sheathed his sword, seized him
      by the collar and the waist band, and hurled his adversary to the other
      end of the barrier, trembling, and mad with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall meet again," murmured De Wardes, rising from the ground and
      picking up his sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have done nothing for the last hour," said Raoul, rising from the
      ground, "but say the same thing." Then, turning towards the duke, he said,
      "I entreat you to be silent about this affair; I am ashamed to have gone
      so far, but my anger carried me away, and I ask your forgiveness for it;&mdash;forget
      it, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear viscount," said the duke, pressing with his own the vigorous and
      valiant hand of his companion, "allow me, on the contrary, to remember it,
      and to look after your safety; that man is dangerous,&mdash;he will kill
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father," replied Raoul, "lived for twenty years under the menace of a
      much more formidable enemy, and he still lives."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your father had good friends, viscount."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," sighed Raoul, "such friends, indeed, that none are now left like
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not say that, I beg, at the very moment I offer you my friendship;"
      and Buckingham opened his arms to embrace Raoul, who delightedly received
      the proffered alliance. "In my family," added Buckingham, "you are aware,
      M. de Bragelonne, we die to save our friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it well, duke," replied Raoul.

    <h2>
      Chapter XIII. An Account of what the Chevalier de Lorraine Thought of
      Madame.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nothing further interrupted the journey. Under a pretext that was little
      remarked, M. de Wardes went forward in advance of the others. He took
      Manicamp with him, for his equable and dreamy disposition acted as a
      counterpoise to his own. It is a subject of remark, that quarrelsome and
      restless characters invariably seek the companionship of gentle, timorous
      dispositions, as if the former sought, in the contrast, a repose for their
      own ill-humor, and the latter a protection for their weakness. Buckingham
      and Bragelonne, admitting De Guiche into their friendship, in concert with
      him, sang the praises of the princess during the whole of the journey.
      Bragelonne, had, however, insisted that their three voices should be in
      concert, instead of singing in solo parts, as De Guiche and his rival
      seemed to have acquired a dangerous habit of doing. This style of harmony
      pleased the queen-mother exceedingly, but it was not perhaps so agreeable
      to the young princess, who was an incarnation of coquetry, and who,
      without any fear as far as her own voice was concerned, sought
      opportunities of so perilously distinguishing herself. She possessed one
      of those fearless and incautious dispositions that find gratification in
      an excess of sensitiveness of feeling, and for whom, also, danger has a
      certain fascination. And so her glances, her smiles, her toilette, an
      inexhaustible armory of weapons of offense, were showered on the three
      young men with overwhelming force; and, from her well-stored arsenal
      issued glances, kindly recognitions, and a thousand other little charming
      attentions which were intended to strike at long range the gentlemen who
      formed the escort, the townspeople, the officers of the different cities
      she passed through, pages, populace, and servants; it was wholesale
      slaughter, a general devastation. By the time Madame arrived at Paris, she
      had reduced to slavery about a hundred thousand lovers: and brought in her
      train to Paris half a dozen men who were almost mad about her, and two who
      were, indeed, literally out of their minds. Raoul was the only person who
      divined the power of this woman's attraction, and as his heart was already
      engaged, he arrived in the capital full of indifference and distrust.
      Occasionally during the journey he conversed with the queen of England
      respecting the power of fascination which Madame possessed, and the
      mother, whom so many misfortunes and deceptions had taught experience,
      replied: "Henrietta was sure to be illustrious in one way or another,
      whether born in a palace or born in obscurity; for she is a woman of great
      imagination, capricious and self-willed." De Wardes and Manicamp, in their
      self-assumed character of courtiers, had announced the princess's arrival.
      The procession was met at Nanterre by a brilliant escort of cavaliers and
      carriages. It was Monsieur himself, followed by the Chevalier de Lorraine
      and by his favorites, the latter being themselves followed by a portion of
      the king's military household, who had arrived to meet his affianced
      bride. At St. Germain, the princess and her mother had changed their heavy
      traveling carriage, somewhat impaired by the journey, for a light, richly
      decorated chariot drawn by six horses with white and gold harness. Seated
      in this open carriage, as though upon a throne, and beneath a parasol of
      embroidered silk, fringed with feathers, sat the young and lovely
      princess, on whose beaming face were reflected the softened rose-tints
      which suited her delicate skin to perfection. Monsieur, on reaching the
      carriage, was struck by her beauty; he showed his admiration in so marked
      a manner that the Chevalier de Lorraine shrugged his shoulders as he
      listened to his compliments, while Buckingham and De Guiche were almost
      heart-broken. After the usual courtesies had been rendered, and the
      ceremony completed, the procession slowly resumed the road to Paris. The
      presentations had been carelessly made, and Buckingham, with the rest of
      the English gentlemen, had been introduced to Monsieur, from whom they had
      received but very indifferent attention. But, during their progress, as he
      observed that the duke devoted himself with his accustomed eagerness to
      the carriage-door, he asked the Chevalier de Lorraine, his inseparable
      companion, "Who is that cavalier?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was presented to your highness a short while ago; it is the handsome
      Duke of Buckingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes, I remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame's knight," added the favorite, with an inflection of the voice
      which envious minds can alone give to the simplest phrases.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you say?" replied the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said 'Madame's knight'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has she a recognized knight, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One would think you can judge of that for yourself; look, only, how they
      are laughing and flirting. All three of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by <i>all three?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not see that De Guiche is one of the party?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I see. But what does that prove?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That Madame has two admirers instead of one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You poison the simplest thing!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I poison nothing. Ah! your royal highness's mind is perverted. The honors
      of the kingdom of France are being paid to your wife and you are not
      satisfied."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Orleans dreaded the satirical humor of the Chevalier de
      Lorraine whenever it reached a certain degree of bitterness, and he
      changed the conversation abruptly. "The princess is pretty," said he, very
      negligently, as if he were speaking of a stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied the chevalier, in the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say 'yes' like a 'no'. She has very beautiful black eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but small."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is so, but they are brilliant. She is tall, and of a good figure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy she stoops a little, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not deny it. She has a noble appearance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but her face is thin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought her teeth beautiful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They can easily be seen, for her mouth is large enough. Decidedly, I was
      wrong, my lord; you are certainly handsomer than your wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But do you think me as handsome as Buckingham?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, and he thinks so, too; for look, my lord, he is redoubling his
      attentions to Madame to prevent your effacing the impression he has made."
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur made a movement of impatience, but as he noticed a smile of
      triumph pass across the chevalier's lips, he drew up his horse to a
      foot-pace. "Why," said he, "should I occupy myself any longer about my
      cousin? Do I not already know her? Were we not brought up together? Did I
      not see her at the Louvre when she was quite a child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A great change has taken place in her since then, prince. At the period
      you allude to, she was somewhat less brilliant, and scarcely so proud,
      either. One evening, particularly, you may remember, my lord, the king
      refused to dance with her, because he thought her plain and badly
      dressed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      These words made the Duke of Orleans frown. It was by no means flattering
      for him to marry a princess of whom, when young, the king had not thought
      much. He would probably have retorted, but at this moment De Guiche
      quitted the carriage to join the prince. He had remarked the prince and
      the chevalier together, and full of anxious attention he seemed to try and
      guess the nature of the remarks which they had just exchanged. The
      chevalier, whether he had some treacherous object in view, or from
      imprudence, did not take the trouble to dissimulate. "Count," he said,
      "you're a man of excellent taste."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you for the compliment," replied De Guiche; "but why do you say
      that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well I appeal to his highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt of it," said Monsieur; "and Guiche knows perfectly well that I
      regard him as a most finished cavalier."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, since that is decided, I resume. You have been in the princess's
      society, count, for the last eight days, have you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied De Guiche, coloring in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well then, tell us frankly, what do you think of her personal
      appearance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of her personal appearance?" returned De Guiche, stupefied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; of her appearance, of her mind, of herself, in fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      Astounded by this question, De Guiche hesitated answering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, De Guiche," resumed the chevalier, laughingly, "tell us your
      opinion frankly; the prince commands it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," said the prince, "be frank."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche stammered out a few unintelligible words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am perfectly well aware," returned Monsieur, "that the subject is a
      delicate one, but you know you can tell me everything. What do you think
      of her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to avoid betraying his real thoughts, De Guiche had recourse to
      the only defense which a man taken by surprise really has, and accordingly
      told an untruth. "I do not find Madame," he said, "either good or bad
      looking, yet rather good than bad looking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! count," exclaimed the chevalier, "you who went into such ecstasies
      and uttered so many exclamations at the sight of her portrait."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche colored violently. Very fortunately, his horse, which was
      slightly restive, enabled him by a sudden plunge to conceal his agitation.
      "What portrait?" he murmured, joining them again. The chevalier had not
      taken his eyes off him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, the portrait. Was not the miniature a good likeness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not remember. I had forgotten the portrait; it quite escaped my
      recollection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet it made a very marked impression upon you," said the chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not unlikely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she witty, at all events?" inquired the duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe so, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is M. de Buckingham witty, too?" said the chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My own opinion is that he must be," replied the chevalier, "for he makes
      Madame laugh, and she seems to take no little pleasure in his society,
      which never happens to a clever woman when in the company of a simpleton."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, then, he must be clever," said De Guiche, simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Raoul opportunely arrived, seeing how De Guiche was pressed
      by his dangerous questioner, to whom he addressed a remark, and in that
      way changed the conversation. The <i>entree</i> was brilliant and joyous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, in honor of his brother, had directed that the festivities
      should be on a scale of the greatest possible magnificence. Madame and her
      mother alighted at the Louvre, where, during their exile they had so
      gloomily submitted to obscurity, misery, and privations of every
      description. That palace, which had been so inhospitable a residence for
      the unhappy daughter of Henry IV., the naked walls, the uneven floorings,
      the ceilings matted with cobwebs, the vast dilapidated chimney-places, the
      cold hearths on which the charity extended to them by parliament hardly
      permitted a fire to glow, was completely altered in appearance. The
      richest hangings and the thickest carpets, glistening flagstones, and
      pictures, with their richly gilded frames; in every direction could be
      seen candelabra, mirrors, and furniture and fittings of the most sumptuous
      character; in every direction, also, were guards of the proudest military
      bearing, with floating plumes, crowds of attendants and courtiers in the
      ante-chambers and upon the staircases. In the courtyards, where the grass
      had formerly been allowed to luxuriate, as if the ungrateful Mazarin had
      thought it a good idea to let the Parisians perceive the solitude and
      disorder were, with misery and despair, the fit accompaniments of fallen
      monarchy; the immense courtyards, formerly silent and desolate, were now
      thronged with courtiers whose horses were pacing and prancing to and fro.
      The carriages were filled with young and beautiful women, who awaited the
      opportunity of saluting, as she passed, the daughter of that daughter of
      France who, during her widowhood and exile, had sometimes gone without
      wood for her fire, and bread for her table, whom the meanest attendant at
      the chateau had treated with indifference and contempt. And so, the Madame
      Henriette once more returned to the Louvre, with her heart more swollen
      with bitter recollections than her daughter's, whose disposition was
      fickle and forgetful, with triumph and delight. She knew but too well this
      brilliant reception was paid to the happy mother of a king restored to his
      throne, a throne second to none in Europe, while the worse than
      indifferent reception she had before met with was paid to her, the
      daughter of Henry IV., as a punishment for having been unfortunate. After
      the princess had been installed in their apartments and had rested, the
      gentlemen who had formed their escort, having, in like manner, recovered
      from their fatigue, they resumed their accustomed habits and occupations.
      Raoul began by setting off to see his father, who had left for Blois. He
      then tried to see M. d'Artagnan, who, however, being engaged in the
      organization of a military household for the king, could not be found
      anywhere. Bragelonne next sought out De Guiche, but the count was occupied
      in a long conference with his tailors and with Manicamp, which consumed
      his whole time. With the Duke of Buckingham he fared still worse, for the
      duke was purchasing horses after horses, diamonds upon diamonds. He
      monopolized every embroiderer, jeweler, and tailor that Paris could boast
      of. Between De Guiche and himself a vigorous contest ensued, invariably a
      courteous one, in which, in order to insure success, the duke was ready to
      spend a million; while the Marechal de Gramont had only allowed his son
      sixty thousand francs. So Buckingham laughed and spent his money. Guiche
      groaned in despair, and would have shown it more violently, had it not
      been for the advice De Bragelonne gave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A million!" repeated De Guiche daily; "I must submit. Why will not the
      marechal advance me a portion of my patrimony?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you would throw it away," said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can that matter to him? If I am to die of it, I shall die of it, and
      then I shall need nothing further."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what need is there to die?" said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not wish to be conquered in elegance by an Englishman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear count," said Manicamp, "elegance is not a costly commodity, it is
      only a very difficult accomplishment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but difficult things cost a good deal of money, and I have only got
      sixty thousand francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very embarrassing state of things, truly," said De Wardes; "even if you
      spent as much as Buckingham, there is only nine hundred and forty thousand
      francs difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where am I to find them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get into debt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am in debt already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A greater reason for getting further."
    </p>
    <p>
      Advice like this resulted in De Guiche becoming excited to such an extent
      that he committed extravagances where Buckingham only incurred expenses.
      The rumor of this extravagant profuseness delighted the hearts of all the
      shopkeepers in Paris; from the hotel of the Duke of Buckingham to that of
      the Comte de Gramont nothing but miracles was attempted. While all this
      was going on, Madame was resting herself, and Bragelonne was engaged in
      writing to Mademoiselle de la Valliere. He had already dispatched four
      letters, and not an answer to any one of them had been received, when, on
      the very morning fixed for the marriage ceremony, which was to take place
      in the chapel at the Palais Royal, Raoul, who was dressing, heard his
      valet announce M. de Malicorne. "What can this Malicorne want with me?"
      thought Raoul; and then said to his valet, "Let him wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a gentleman from Blois," said the valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admit him at once," said Raoul, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne entered as brilliant as a star, and wearing a superb sword at
      his side. After having saluted Raoul most gracefully, he said: "M. de
      Bragelonne, I am the bearer of a thousand compliments from a lady to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul colored. "From a lady," said he, "from a lady of Blois?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, monsieur; from Mademoiselle de Montalais."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, monsieur; I recollect you now," said Raoul. "And what does
      Mademoiselle de Montalais require of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne drew four letters from his pocket, which he offered to Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My own letters, is it possible?" he said, turning pale; "my letters, and
      the seals unbroken?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur, your letters did not find at Blois the person to whom they were
      addressed, and so they are now returned to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle de la Valliere has left Blois, then?" exclaimed Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eight days ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is she, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is it known that these letters were from me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle de Montalais recognized your handwriting and your seal,"
      said Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul colored and smiled. "Mademoiselle de Montalais is exceedingly
      amiable," he said; "she is always kind and charming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely she could have given me some precise information about
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere. I never could find her in this immense city."
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne drew another packet from his pocket. "You may possibly find in
      this letter what you are anxious to learn."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul hurriedly broke the seal. The writing was that of Mademoiselle Aure,
      and inclosed were these words:&mdash;"Paris, Palais Royal. The day of the
      nuptial blessing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does this mean?" inquired Raoul of Malicorne; "you probably know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For pity's sake, tell me, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because Mademoiselle Aure has forbidden me to do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul looked at his strange visitor, and remained silent;&mdash;"At least,
      tell me whether it is fortunate or unfortunate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you will see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very severe in your reservations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you grant me one favor, monsieur?" said Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In exchange for that you refuse me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have the greatest desire to see the ceremony, and I have no ticket to
      admit me, in spite of all the steps I have taken to secure one. Could you
      get me admitted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do me this kindness, then, I entreat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most willingly, monsieur; come with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am exceedingly indebted to you, monsieur," said Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you were a friend of M. de Manicamp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am, monsieur; but this morning I was with him as he was dressing, and I
      let a bottle of blacking fall over his new dress, and he flew at me sword
      in hand, so that I was obliged to make my escape. That is the reason I
      could not ask him for a ticket. He wanted to kill me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can well believe it," laughed Raoul. "I know Manicamp is capable of
      killing a man who has been unfortunate enough to commit the crime you have
      to reproach yourself with, but I will repair the mischief as far as you
      are concerned. I will but fasten my cloak, and shall then be ready to
      serve you, not only as a guide, but as your introducer, too."

    <h2>
      Chapter XIV. A Surprise for Raoul.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Madame's marriage was celebrated in the chapel of the Palais Royal, in the
      presence of a crowd of courtiers, who had been most scrupulously selected.
      However, notwithstanding the marked favor which an invitation indicated,
      Raoul, faithful to his promise to Malicorne, who was so anxious to witness
      the ceremony, obtained admission for him. After he had fulfilled this
      engagement, Raoul approached De Guiche, who, as if in contrast with his
      magnificent costume, exhibited a countenance so utterly dejected, that the
      Duke of Buckingham was the only one present who could contend with him as
      far as pallor and discomfiture were concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, count," said Raoul, approaching his friend, and preparing to
      support him at the moment the archbishop blessed the married couple. In
      fact, the Prince of Conde was attentively scrutinizing these two images of
      desolation, standing like caryatides on either side of the nave of the
      church. The count, after that, kept a more careful watch over himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the termination of the ceremony, the king and queen passed onward
      towards the grand reception-room, where Madame and her suite were to be
      presented to them. It was remarked that the king, who had seemed more than
      surprised at his sister-in-law's appearance, was most flattering in his
      compliments to her. Again, it was remarked that the queen-mother, fixing a
      long and thoughtful gaze upon Buckingham, leaned towards Madame de
      Motteville as though to ask her, "Do you not see how much he resembles his
      father?" and finally it was remarked that Monsieur watched everybody, and
      seemed quite discontented. After the reception of the princess and
      ambassadors, Monsieur solicited the king's permission to present to him as
      well as to Madame the persons belonging to their new household.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you aware, vicomte," inquired the Prince de Conde of Raoul, "whether
      the household has been selected by a person of taste, and whether there
      are any faces worth looking at?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not the slightest idea, monseigneur," replied Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You affect ignorance, surely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way, monseigneur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a friend of De Guiche, who is one of the friends of the prince."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may be so, monseigneur; but the matter having no interest whatever
      for me, I have never questioned De Guiche on the subject; and De Guiche,
      on his part, never having been questioned, did not communicate any
      particulars to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Manicamp?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true I saw Manicamp at Le Havre, and during the journey here, but I
      was no more inquisitive with him than I had been towards De Guiche.
      Besides, is it likely that Manicamp should know anything of such matters?
      for he is a person of only secondary importance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear vicomte, do you not know better than that?" said the prince;
      "why, it is these persons of secondary importance, who, on such occasions,
      have all the influence; and the truth is, that nearly everything has been
      done through Manicamp's presentations to De Guiche, and through De Guiche
      to Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I assure you, monseigneur, I was ignorant of that," said Raoul, "and what
      your highness does me the honor to impart is perfectly new to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will most readily believe you, although it seems incredible; besides we
      shall not have long to wait. See, the flying squadron is advancing, as
      good Queen Catherine used to say. Ah! ah! what pretty faces!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A bevy of young girls at this moment entered the <i>salon</i>, conducted
      by Madame de Navailles, and to Manicamp's credit be it said, if indeed he
      had taken that part in their selection which the Prince de Conde assigned
      him, it was a display calculated to dazzle those who, like the prince,
      could appreciate every character and style of beauty. A young,
      fair-complexioned girl, from twenty to one-and-twenty years of age, and
      whose large blue eyes flashed, as she opened them, in the most dazzling
      manner, walked at the head of the band and was the first presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente," said Madame de Navailles to Monsieur,
      who, as he saluted his wife, repeated "Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! ah!" said the Prince de Conde to Raoul, "she is presentable enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Raoul, "but has she not a somewhat haughty style?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah! we know these airs very well, vicomte; three months hence she will
      be tame enough. But look, there, indeed, is a pretty face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Raoul, "and one I am acquainted with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais," said Madame de Navailles. The name and
      Christian name were carefully repeated by Monsieur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great heavens!" exclaimed Raoul, fixing his bewildered gaze upon the
      entrance doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?" inquired the prince; "was it Mademoiselle Aure de
      Montalais who made you utter such a 'Great heavens'?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, monseigneur, no," replied Raoul, pale and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, if it be not Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais, it is that
      pretty <i>blonde</i> who follows her. What beautiful eyes! She is rather
      thin, but has fascinations without number."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle de la Baume le Blanc de la Valliere!" said Madame de
      Navailles; and, as this name resounded through his whole being, a cloud
      seemed to rise from his breast to his eyes, so that he neither saw nor
      heard anything more; and the prince, finding him nothing more than a mere
      echo which remained silent under his railleries, moved forward to inspect
      somewhat closer the beautiful girls whom his first glance had already
      particularized.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Louise here! Louise a maid of honor to Madame!" murmured Raoul, and his
      eyes, which did not suffice to satisfy his reason, wandered from Louise to
      Montalais. The latter had already emancipated herself from her assumed
      timidity, which she only needed for the presentation and for her
      reverences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Montalais, from the corner of the room to which she had
      retired, was looking with no slight confidence at the different persons
      present; and, having discovered Raoul, she amused herself with the
      profound astonishment which her own and her friend's presence there caused
      the unhappy lover. Her waggish and malicious look, which Raoul tried to
      avoid meeting, and which yet he sought inquiringly from time to time,
      placed him on the rack. As for Louise, whether from natural timidity, or
      some other reason for which Raoul could not account, she kept her eyes
      constantly cast down; intimidated, dazzled, and with impeded respiration,
      she withdrew herself as much as possible aside, unaffected even by the
      nudges Montalais gave her with her elbow. The whole scene was a perfect
      enigma for Raoul, the key to which he would have given anything to obtain.
      But no one was there who could assist him, not even Malicorne; who, a
      little uneasy at finding himself in the presence of so many persons of
      good birth, and not a little discouraged by Montalais's bantering glances,
      had described a circle, and by degrees succeeded in getting a few paces
      from the prince, behind the group of maids of honor, and nearly within
      reach of Mademoiselle Aure's voice, she being the planet around which he,
      as her attendant satellite, seemed constrained to gravitate. As he
      recovered his self-possession, Raoul fancied he recognized voices on his
      right hand side that were familiar to him, and he perceived De Wardes, De
      Guiche, and the Chevalier de Lorraine conversing together. It is true they
      were talking in tones so low, that the sound of their words could hardly
      be heard in the vast apartment. To speak in that manner from any
      particular place without bending down, or turning round, or looking at the
      person with whom one may be engaged in conversation, is a talent that
      cannot be immediately acquired by newcomers. Long study is needed for such
      conversations, which, without a look, gesture, or movement of the head,
      seem like the conversation of a group of statues. In fact, the king's and
      queen's grand assemblies, while their majesties were speaking, and while
      every one present seemed to be listening in the midst of the most profound
      silence, some of these noiseless conversations took place, in which
      adulation was not the prevailing feature. But Raoul was one among others
      exceedingly clever in this art, so much a matter of etiquette, that from
      the movement of the lips, he was often able to guess the sense of the
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is that Montalais?" inquired De Wardes, "and that La Valliere? What
      country-town have we had sent here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Montalais?" said the chevalier,&mdash;"oh, I know her; she is a good sort
      of girl, whom we shall find amusing enough. La Valliere is a charming
      girl, slightly lame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! bah!" said De Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not be absurd, De Wardes, there are some very characteristic and
      ingenious Latin axioms about lame ladies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen, gentlemen," said De Guiche, looking at Raoul with uneasiness,
      "be a little careful, I entreat you."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the uneasiness of the count, in appearance at least, was not needed.
      Raoul had preserved the firmest and most indifferent countenance, although
      he had not lost a word that passed. He seemed to keep an account of the
      insolence and license of the two speakers in order to settle matters with
      them at the earliest opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes seemed to guess what was passing in his mind, and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are these young ladies' lovers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Montalais's lover?" said the chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Montalais first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, I, or De Guiche,&mdash;whoever likes, in fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle de la Valliere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, gentlemen," exclaimed De Guiche, anxious to put a stop to the
      chevalier's reply; "take care, Madame is listening to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul had thrust his hand up to the wrist into his <i>justaucorps</i> in
      great agitation. But the very malignity which he saw was excited against
      these poor girls made him take a serious resolution. "Poor Louise," he
      thought, "has come here only with an honorable object in view, and under
      honorable protection; and I must learn what that object is which she has
      in view, and who it is that protects her." And following Malicorne's
      maneuver, he made his way toward the group of the maids of honor. The
      presentations were soon over. The king, who had done nothing but look at
      and admire Madame, shortly afterwards left the reception-room, accompanied
      by the two queens. The Chevalier de Lorraine resumed his place beside
      Monsieur, and, as he accompanied him, insinuated a few drops of the venom
      he had collected during the last hour, while looking at some of the faces
      in the court, and suspecting that some of their hearts might be happy. A
      few of the persons present followed the king as he quitted the apartment;
      but such of the courtiers as assumed an independence of character, and
      professed a gallantry of disposition, began to approach the ladies of the
      court. The prince paid his compliments to Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente,
      Buckingham devoted himself to Madame Chalais and Mademoiselle de
      Lafayette, whom Madame already distinguished by her notice, and whom she
      held in high regard. As for the Comte de Guiche, who had abandoned
      Monsieur as soon as he could approach Madame alone, he conversed, with
      great animation, with Madame de Valentinois, and with Mademoiselle de
      Crequy and de Chatillon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid these varied political, and amorous interests, Malicorne was anxious
      to gain Montalais's attention; but the latter preferred talking with
      Raoul, even if it were only to amuse herself with his innumerable
      questions and his astonishment. Raoul had gone directly to Mademoiselle de
      la Valliere, and had saluted her with the profoundest respect, at which
      Louise blushed, and could not say a word. Montalais, however, hurried to
      her assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, monsieur le vicomte, here we are, you see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, indeed, see you," said Raoul smiling, "and it is exactly because
      you are here that I wish to ask for some explanation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne approached the group with his most fascinating smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go away, Malicorne; really you are exceedingly indiscreet." At this
      remark Malicorne bit his lips and retired a few steps, without making any
      reply. His smile, however, changed its expression, and from its former
      frankness, became mocking in its expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wished for an explanation, M. Raoul?" inquired Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is surely worth one, I think; Mademoiselle de la Valliere is a maid of
      honor to Madame!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should she not be a maid of honor, as well as myself?" inquired
      Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray accept my compliments, young ladies," said Raoul, who fancied he
      perceived they were not disposed to answer him in a direct manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your remark was not made in a very complimentary manner, vicomte."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly; I appeal to Louise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Bragelonne probably thinks the position is above my condition,"
      said Louise, hesitatingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assuredly not," replied Raoul, eagerly, "you know very well that such is
      not my feeling; were you called upon to occupy a queen's throne, I should
      not be surprised; how much greater reason, then, such a position as this?
      The only circumstance that amazes me is, that I should have learned it
      only to-day, and that by the merest accident."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is true," replied Montalais, with her usual giddiness; "you know
      nothing about it, and there is no reason you should. M. de Bragelonne had
      written several letters to you, but your mother was the only person who
      remained behind at Blois, and it was necessary to prevent these letters
      from falling into her hands; I intercepted them, and returned them to M.
      Raoul, so that he believed you were still at Blois while you were here in
      Paris, and had no idea whatever, indeed, how high you had risen in rank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you not inform M. Raoul, as I begged you to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should I? to give him opportunity of making some of his severe
      remarks and moral reflections, and to undo what we have had so much
      trouble in effecting? Certainly not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I so very severe, then?" said Raoul, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides," said Montalais, "it is sufficient to say that it suited me. I
      was about setting off for Paris&mdash;you were away; Louise was weeping
      her eyes out; interpret that as you please; I begged a friend, a protector
      of mine, who had obtained the appointment for me, to solicit one for
      Louise; the appointment arrived. Louise left in order to get her costume
      prepared; as I had my own ready, I remained behind; I received your
      letters, and returned them to you, adding a few words, promising you a
      surprise. Your surprise is before you, monsieur, and seems to be a fair
      one enough; you have nothing more to ask. Come, M. Malicorne, it is now
      time to leave these young people together: they have many things to talk
      about; give me your hand; I trust that you appreciate the honor conferred
      upon you, M. Malicorne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me," said Raoul, arresting the giddy girl, and giving to his
      voice an intonation, the gravity of which contrasted with that of
      Montalais; "forgive me, but may I inquire the name of the protector you
      speak of; for if protection be extended towards you, Mademoiselle de
      Montalais,&mdash;for which, indeed, so many reasons exist," added Raoul,
      bowing, "I do not see that the same reasons exist why Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere should be similarly cared for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, M. Raoul," said Louise, innocently, "there is no difference in the
      matter, and I do not see why I should not tell it you myself; it was M.
      Malicorne who obtained it for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul remained for a moment almost stupefied, asking himself if they were
      trifling with him; he then turned round to interrogate Malicorne, but he
      had been hurried away by Montalais, and was already at some distance from
      them. Mademoiselle de la Valliere attempted to follow her friend, but
      Raoul, with gentle authority, detained her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Louise, one word, I beg."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, M. Raoul," said Louise, blushing, "we are alone. Every one has left.
      They will become anxious, and will be looking for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fear nothing," said the young man, smiling, "we are neither of us of
      sufficient importance for our absence to be remarked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I have my duty to perform, M. Raoul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not be alarmed, I am acquainted with these usages of the court; you
      will not be on duty until to-morrow; a few minutes are at your disposal,
      which will enable you to give me the information I am about to have the
      honor to ask you for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How serious you are, M. Raoul!" said Louise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because the circumstances are serious. Are you listening?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am listening; I would only repeat, monsieur, that we are quite alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," said Raoul, and, offering her his hand, he led the young
      girl into the gallery adjoining the reception-room, the windows of which
      looked out upon the courtyard. Every one hurried towards the middle
      window, which had a balcony outside, from which all the details of the
      slow and formal preparations for departure could be seen. Raoul opened one
      of the side windows, and then, being alone with Louise, said to her: "You
      know, Louise, that from my childhood I have regarded you as my sister, as
      one who has been the confidante of all my troubles, to whom I have
      entrusted all my hopes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, M. Raoul," she answered softly; "yes, M. Raoul, I know that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You used, on your side, to show the same friendship towards me, and had
      the same confidence in me; why have you not, on this occasion, been my
      friend,&mdash;why have you shown suspicion of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere did not answer. "I fondly thought you loved
      me," said Raoul, whose voice became more and more agitated; "I fondly
      thought you consented to all the plans we had, together, laid down for our
      own happiness, at the time when we wandered up and down the walks of
      Cour-Cheverny, under the avenue of poplar trees leading to Blois. You do
      not answer me, Louise. Is it possible," he inquired, breathing with
      difficulty, "that you no longer love me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not say so," replied Louise, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! tell me the truth, I implore you. All my hopes in life are centered
      in you. I chose you for your gentle and simple tastes. Do not suffer
      yourself to be dazzled, Louise, now that you are in the midst of a court
      where all that is pure too soon becomes corrupt&mdash;where all that is
      young too soon grows old. Louise, close your ears, so as not to hear what
      may be said; shut your eyes, so as not to see the examples before you;
      shut your lips, that you may not inhale the corrupting influences about
      you. Without falsehood or subterfuge, Louise, am I to believe what
      Mademoiselle de Montalais stated? Louise, did you come to Paris because I
      was no longer at Blois?"
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere blushed and concealed her face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it was so, then!" exclaimed Raoul, delightedly; "that was, then,
      your reason for coming here. I love you as I never yet loved you. Thanks,
      Louise, for this devotion; but measures must be taken to place you beyond
      all insult, to shield you from every lure. Louise, a maid of honor, in the
      court of a young princess in these days of free manners and inconstant
      affections&mdash;a maid of honor is placed as an object of attack without
      having any means of defence afforded her; this state of things cannot
      continue; you must be married in order to be respected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Married?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, here is my hand, Louise; will you place yours within it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But your father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My father leaves me perfectly free."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand your scruples, Louise; I will consult my father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reflect, M. Raoul; wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait! it is impossible. Reflect, Louise, when <i>you</i> are concerned!
      it would be insulting,&mdash;give me your hand, dear Louise; I am my own
      master. My father will consent, I know; give me your hand, do not keep me
      waiting thus. One word in answer, one word only; if not, I shall begin to
      think that, in order to change you forever, nothing more was needed than a
      single step in the palace, a single breath of favor, a smile from the
      queen, a look from the king."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul had no sooner pronounced this latter word, than La Valliere became
      as pale as death, no doubt from fear at seeing the young man excite
      himself. With a movement as rapid as thought, she placed both her hands in
      those of Raoul, and then fled, without adding a syllable; disappearing
      without casting a look behind her. Raoul felt his whole frame tremble at
      the contact of her hand; he received the compact as a solemn bargain wrung
      by affection from her child-like timidity.

    <h2>
      Chapter XV. The Consent of Athos.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Raoul quitted the Palais Royal full of ideas that admitted no delay in
      execution. He mounted his horse in the courtyard, and followed the road to
      Blois, while the marriage festivities of Monsieur and the princess of
      England were being celebrated with exceeding animation by the courtiers,
      but to the despair of De Guiche and Buckingham. Raoul lost no time on the
      road, and in sixteen hours he arrived at Blois. As he traveled along, he
      marshaled his arguments in the most becoming manner. Fever is an argument
      that cannot be answered, and Raoul had an attack. Athos was in his study,
      making additions to his memoirs, when Raoul entered, accompanied by
      Grimaud. Keen-sighted and penetrating, a mere glance at his son told him
      that something extraordinary had befallen him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to come on a matter of importance," said he to Raoul, after he
      had embraced him, pointing to a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, monsieur," replied the young man; "and I entreat you to give me the
      same kind attention that has never yet failed me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak, Raoul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I present the case to you, monsieur, free from all preface, for that
      would be unworthy of you. Mademoiselle de la Valliere is in Paris as one
      of Madame's maids of honor. I have pondered deeply on the matter; I love
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere above everything; and it is not proper to
      leave her in a position where her reputation, her virtue even, may be
      assailed. It is my wish, therefore, to marry her, monsieur, and I have
      come to solicit your consent to my marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      While this communication was being made to him, Athos maintained the
      profoundest silence and reserve. Raoul, who had begun his address with an
      assumption of self-possession, finished it by allowing a manifest emotion
      to escape him at every word. Athos fixed upon Bragelonne a searching look,
      overshadowed indeed by a slight sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have reflected well upon it?" he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you are already acquainted with my views respecting this
      alliance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, monsieur," replied Raoul, in a low tone of voice; "but you added,
      that if I persisted&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do persist, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul stammered out an almost unintelligible assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your passion," continued Athos, tranquilly, "must indeed be very great,
      since, notwithstanding my dislike to this union, you persist in wanting
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul passed his hand trembling across his forehead to remove the
      perspiration that collected there. Athos looked at him, and his heart was
      touched by pity. He rose and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no matter. My own personal feelings are not to be taken into
      consideration since yours are concerned; I am ready to give it. Tell me
      what you want."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your kind indulgence, first of all, monsieur," said Raoul, taking hold of
      his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have mistaken my feelings, Raoul, I have more than mere indulgence
      for you in my heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul kissed as devotedly as a lover could have done the hand he held in
      his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come," said Athos, "I am quite ready; what do you wish me to sign?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing whatever, monsieur, only it would be very kind if you would take
      the trouble to write to the king, to whom I belong, and solicit his
      majesty's permission for me to marry Mademoiselle de la Valliere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well thought, Raoul! After, or rather before myself, you have a master to
      consult, that master being the king; it is loyal in you to submit yourself
      voluntarily to this double proof; I will grant your request without delay,
      Raoul."
    </p>
    <p>
      The count approached the window, and leaning out, called to Grimaud, who
      showed his head from an arbor covered with jasmine, which he was occupied
      in trimming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My horses, Grimaud," continued the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why this order, monsieur?" inquired Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall set off in a few hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whither?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Paris, monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is not the king at Paris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, ought we not to go there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, monsieur," said Raoul, almost alarmed by this kind condescension. "I
      do not ask you to put yourself to such inconvenience, and a letter merely&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mistake my position, Raoul; it is not respectful that a simple
      gentleman, such as I am, should write to his sovereign. I wish to speak, I
      ought to speak, to the king, and I will do so. We will go together,
      Raoul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You overpower me with your kindness, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you think his majesty is affected?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Towards me, monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellently well disposed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You <i>know</i> that to be so?" continued the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king has himself told me so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On what occasion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon the recommendation of M. d'Artagnan, I believe, and on account of an
      affair in the Place de Greve, when I had the honor to draw my sword in the
      king's service. I have reason to believe that, vanity apart, I stand well
      with his majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I entreat you, monsieur," pursued Raoul, "not to maintain towards me
      your present grave and serious manner. Do not make me bitterly regret
      having listened to a feeling stronger than anything else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the second time you have said so, Raoul; it was quite
      unnecessary; you require my formal consent, and you have it. We need talk
      no more on the subject, therefore. Come and see my new plantations,
      Raoul."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man knew very well, that, after the expression of his father's
      wish, no opportunity of discussion was left him. He bowed his head, and
      followed his father into the garden. Athos slowly pointed out to him the
      grafts, the cuttings, and the avenues he was planting. This perfect repose
      of manner disconcerted Raoul extremely; the affection with which his own
      heart was filled seemed so great that the whole world could hardly contain
      it. How, then, could his father's heart remain void, and closed to its
      influence? Bragelonne, therefore, collecting all his courage, suddenly
      exclaimed,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is impossible, monsieur, you can have any reason to reject
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere! In Heaven's name, she is so good, so gentle
      and pure, that your mind, so perfect in its penetration, ought to
      appreciate her accordingly. Does any secret repugnance, or any hereditary
      dislike, exist between you and her family?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look, Raoul, at that beautiful lily of the valley," said Athos; "observe
      how the shade and the damp situation suit it, particularly the shadow
      which that sycamore-tree casts over it, so that the warmth, and not the
      blazing heat of the sun, filters through its leaves."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul stopped, bit his lips, and then, with the blood mantling in his
      face, he said, courageously,&mdash;"One word of explanation, I beg,
      monsieur. You cannot forget that your son is a man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case," replied Athos, drawing himself up with sternness, "prove
      to me that you are a man, for you do not show yourself a son. I begged you
      to wait the opportunity of forming an illustrious alliance. I would have
      obtained a wife for you from the first ranks of the rich nobility. I wish
      you to be distinguished by the splendor which glory and fortune confer,
      for nobility of descent you have already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," exclaimed Raoul, carried away by a first impulse. "I was
      reproached the other day for not knowing who my mother was."
    </p>
    <p>
      Athos turned pale; then, knitting his brows like the greatest of all the
      heathen deities:&mdash;"I am waiting to learn the reply you made," he
      demanded, in an imperious manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me! oh, forgive me," murmured the young man, sinking at once from
      the lofty tone he had assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was your reply, monsieur?" inquired the count, stamping his feet
      upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur, my sword was in my hand immediately, my adversary placed
      himself on guard, I struck his sword over the palisade, and threw him
      after it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you suffer him to live?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king has prohibited duelling, and, at the moment, I was an ambassador
      of the king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said Athos, "but all the greater reason I should see his
      majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you intend to ask him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Authority to draw my sword against the man who has inflicted this injury
      upon me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I did not act as I ought to have done, I beg you to forgive me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I reproach you, Raoul?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, the permission you are going to ask from the king?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will implore his majesty to sign your marriage-contract, but on one
      condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are conditions necessary with me, monsieur? Command, and you shall be
      obeyed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the condition, I repeat," continued Athos; "that you tell me the name
      of the man who spoke of your mother in that way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What need is there that you should know his name; the offense was
      directed against myself, and the permission once obtained from his
      majesty, to revenge it is my affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me his name, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not allow you to expose yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you take me for a Don Diego? His name, I say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You insist upon it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I demand it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Vicomte de Wardes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said Athos, tranquilly, "I know him. But our horses are
      ready, I see; and, instead of delaying our departure for a couple of
      hours, we will set off at once. Come, monsieur."

      Chapter XVI. Monsieur Becomes Jealous of the Duke of Buckingham.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While the Comte de la Fere was proceeding on his way to Pairs, accompanied
      by Raoul, the Palais Royal was the theatre wherein a scene of what Moliere
      would have called excellent comedy, was being performed. Four days had
      elapsed since his marriage, and Monsieur, having breakfasted very
      hurriedly, passed into his ante-chamber, frowning and out of temper. The
      repast had not been over-agreeable. Madame had had breakfast served in her
      own apartment, and Monsieur had breakfasted almost alone; the Chevalier de
      Lorraine and Manicamp were the only persons present at the meal, which
      lasted three-quarters of an hour without a single syllable having been
      uttered. Manicamp, who was less intimate with his royal highness than the
      Chevalier de Lorraine, vainly endeavored to detect, from the expression of
      the prince's face, what had made him so ill-humored. The Chevalier de
      Lorraine, who had no occasion to speculate about anything, inasmuch as he
      knew all, ate his breakfast with that extraordinary appetite which the
      troubles of one's friends but stimulates, and enjoyed at the same time
      both Monsieur's ill-humor and the vexation of Manicamp. He seemed
      delighted, while he went on eating, to detain a prince, who was very
      impatient to move, still at table. Monsieur at times repented the
      ascendency which he had permitted the Chevalier de Lorraine to acquire
      over him, and which exempted the latter from any observance of etiquette
      towards him. Monsieur was now in one of those moods, but he dreaded as
      much as he liked the chevalier, and contented himself with nursing his
      anger without betraying it. Every now and then Monsieur raised his eyes to
      the ceiling, then lowered them towards the slices of <i>pate</i> which the
      chevalier was attacking, and finally, not caring to betray the resentment,
      he gesticulated in a manner which Harlequin might have envied. At last,
      however, Monsieur could control himself no longer, and at the dessert,
      rising from the table in excessive wrath, as we have related, he left the
      Chevalier de Lorraine to finish his breakfast as he pleased. Seeing
      Monsieur rise from the table, Manicamp, napkin in hand, rose also.
      Monsieur ran rather than walked, towards the ante-chamber, where, noticing
      an usher in attendance, he gave him some directions in a low tone of
      voice. Then, turning back again, but avoiding passing through the
      breakfast apartment, he crossed several rooms, with the intention of
      seeking the queen-mother in her oratory, where she usually remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was about ten o'clock in the morning. Anne of Austria was engaged in
      writing as Monsieur entered. The queen-mother was extremely attached to
      her son, for he was handsome in person and amiable in disposition. He was,
      in fact, more affectionate, and it might be, more effeminate than the
      king. He pleased his mother by those trifling sympathizing attentions all
      women are glad to receive. Anne of Austria, who would have been rejoiced
      to have had a daughter, almost found in this, her favorite son, the
      attentions, solicitude, and playful manners of a child of twelve years of
      age. All the time he passed with his mother he employed in admiring her
      arms, in giving his opinion upon her cosmetics, and recipes for
      compounding essences, in which she was very particular; and then, too, he
      kissed her hands and cheeks in the most childlike and endearing manner,
      and had always some sweetmeats to offer her, or some new style of dress to
      recommend. Anne of Austria loved the king, or rather the regal power in
      her eldest son; Louis XIV. represented legitimacy by right divine. With
      the king, her character was that of the queen-mother, with Philip she was
      simply the mother. The latter knew that, of all places, a mother's heart
      is the most compassionate and surest. When quite a child he always fled
      there for refuge when he and his brother quarreled, often, after having
      struck him, which constituted the crime of high treason on his part, after
      certain engagements with hands and nails, in which the king and his
      rebellious subject indulged in their night-dresses respecting the right to
      a disputed bed, having their servant Laporte as umpire,&mdash;Philip,
      conqueror, but terrified at victory, used to flee to his mother to obtain
      reinforcements from her, or at least the assurance of forgiveness, which
      Louis XIV. granted with difficulty, and after an interval. Anne, from this
      habit of peaceable intervention, succeeded in arranging the disputes of
      her sons, and in sharing, at the same time, all their secrets. The king,
      somewhat jealous of that maternal solicitude which was bestowed
      particularly on his brother, felt disposed to show towards Anne of Austria
      more submission and attachment than his character really dictated. Anne of
      Austria had adopted this line of conduct especially towards the young
      queen. In this manner she ruled with almost despotic sway over the royal
      household, and she was already preparing her batteries to govern with the
      same absolute authority the household of her second son. Anne experienced
      almost a feeling of pride whenever she saw any one enter her apartment
      with woe-begone looks, pale cheeks, or red eyes, gathering from
      appearances that assistance was required either by the weakest or the most
      rebellious. She was writing, we have said, when Monsieur entered her
      oratory, not with red eyes or pale cheeks, but restless, out of temper,
      and annoyed. With an absent air he kissed his mother's hands, and sat
      himself down before receiving her permission to do so. Considering the
      strict rules of etiquette established at the court of Anne of Austria,
      this forgetfulness of customary civilities was a sign of preoccupation,
      especially on Philip's part, who, of his own accord, observed a respect
      towards her of a somewhat exaggerated character. If, therefore, he so
      notoriously failed in this regard, there must be a serious cause for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter, Philip?" inquired Anne of Austria, turning towards
      her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good many things," murmured the prince, in a doleful tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look like a man who has a great deal to do," said the queen, laying
      down her pen. Philip frowned, but did not reply. "Among the various
      subjects which occupy your mind," said Anne of Austria, "there must surely
      be one that absorbs it more than others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One has indeed occupied me more than any other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what is it? I am listening."
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip opened his mouth as if to express all the troubles his mind was
      filled with, and which he seemed to be waiting only for an opportunity of
      declaring. But he suddenly became silent, and a sigh alone expressed all
      that his heart was overflowing with.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Philip, show a little firmness," said the queen-mother. "When one
      has to complain of anything, it is generally an individual who is the
      cause of it. Am I not right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not say no, madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom do you wish to speak about? Come, take courage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In fact, madame, what I might possibly have to say must be kept a
      profound secret; for when a lady is in the case&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! you are speaking of Madame, then?" inquired the queen-mother, with a
      feeling of the liveliest curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, if you wish to speak of Madame, do not hesitate to do so. I
      am your mother, and she is no more than a stranger to me. Yet, as she is
      my daughter-in-law, rest assured I shall be interested, even were it for
      your own sake alone, in hearing all you may have to say about her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray tell me, madame, in your turn, whether you have not remarked
      something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Something'! Philip? Your words almost frighten me, from their want of
      meaning. What do you mean by 'something?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame is pretty, certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet not altogether beautiful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but as she grows older, she will probably become strikingly
      beautiful. You must have remarked the change which a few years have
      already made in her. Her beauty will improve more and more; she is now
      only sixteen years of age. At fifteen I was, myself, very thin; but even
      as she is at present, Madame is very pretty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And consequently others have remarked it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Undoubtedly, for a woman of ordinary rank is noticed&mdash;and with still
      greater reason a princess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has been well brought up, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame Henriette, her mother, is a woman somewhat cold in manner,
      slightly pretentious, but full of noble thoughts. The princess's education
      may have been neglected, but her principles, I believe, are good. Such at
      least was the opinion I formed of her when she resided in France; but she
      afterwards returned to England, and I am ignorant what may have occurred
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Simply that there are some heads naturally giddy, which are easily turned
      by prosperity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the very word, madame. I think the princess rather giddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must not exaggerate, Philip; she is clever and witty, and has a
      certain amount of coquetry very natural in a young woman; but this defect
      in persons of high rank and position, is a great advantage at a court. A
      princess who is tinged with coquetry usually forms a brilliant court; her
      smile stimulates luxury, arouses wit, and even courage; the nobles, too,
      fight better for a prince whose wife is beautiful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you extremely, madame," said Philip, with some temper; "you really
      have drawn some very alarming pictures for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what respect?" asked the queen, with pretended simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know, madame," said Philip, dolefully, "whether I had or had not a
      very great dislike to getting married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, indeed, you alarm me. You have some serious cause of complaint
      against Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not precisely say it is serious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, then, throw aside your doleful looks. If you show yourself
      to others in your present state, people will take you for a very unhappy
      husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is," replied Philip, "I am not altogether satisfied as a
      husband, and I shall not be sorry if others know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For shame, Philip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, madame, I will tell you frankly that I do not understand the
      life I am required to lead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Explain yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wife does not seem to belong to me; she is always leaving me for some
      reason or another. In the mornings there are visits, correspondences, and
      toilettes; in the evenings, balls and concerts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are jealous, Philip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I! Heaven forbid. Let others act the part of a jealous husband, not I.
      But I <i>am</i> annoyed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All these things you reproach your wife with are perfectly innocent, and,
      so long as you have nothing of greater importance&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet, listen; without being very blamable, a woman can excite a good deal
      of uneasiness. Certain visitors may be received, certain preferences
      shown, which expose young women to remark, and which are enough to drive
      out of their senses even those husbands who are least disposed to be
      jealous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! now we are coming to the real point at last, and not without some
      difficulty. You speak of frequent visits, and certain preferences&mdash;very
      good; for the last hour we have been beating about the bush, and at last
      you have broached the true question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well then, yes&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is more serious than I thought. It is possible, then, that Madame
      can have given you grounds for these complaints against her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, your wife, married only four days ago, prefers some other person to
      yourself? Take care, Philip, you exaggerate your grievances; in wishing to
      prove everything, you prove nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince, bewildered by his mother's serious manner, wished to reply,
      but he could only stammer out some unintelligible words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You draw back, then?" said Anne of Austria. "I prefer that, as it is an
      acknowledgement of your mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" exclaimed Philip, "I do not draw back, and I will prove all I
      asserted. I spoke of preference and of visits, did I not? Well, listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Austria prepared herself to listen, with that love of gossip which
      the best woman living and the best mother, were she a queen even, always
      finds in being mixed up with the petty squabbles of a household.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Philip, "tell me one thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why does my wife retain an English court about her?" said Philip, as he
      crossed his arms and looked his mother steadily in the face, as if he were
      convinced that she could not answer the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For a very simple reason," returned Anne of Austria; "because the English
      are her countrymen, because they have expended large sums in order to
      accompany her to France, and because it would hardly be polite &mdash;not
      politic, certainly&mdash;to dismiss abruptly those members of the English
      nobility who have not shrunk from any devotion or sacrifice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A wonderful sacrifice indeed," returned Philip, "to desert a wretched
      country to come to a beautiful one, where a greater effect can be produced
      for a guinea that can be procured elsewhere for four! Extraordinary
      devotion, really, to travel a hundred leagues in company with a woman one
      is in love with!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In love, Philip! think what you are saying. Who is in love with Madame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Duke of Buckingham. Perhaps you will defend him, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Austria blushed and smiled at the same time. The name of the Duke
      of Buckingham recalled certain recollections of a very tender and
      melancholy nature. "The Duke of Buckingham?" she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; one of those arm-chair soldiers&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Buckinghams are loyal and brave," said Anne of Austria, courageously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is too bad; my own mother takes the part of my wife's lover against
      me," exclaimed Philip, incensed to such an extent that his weak
      organization was affected almost to tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Philip, my son," exclaimed Anne of Austria, "such an expression is
      unworthy of you. Your wife has no lover; and, had she one, it would not be
      the Duke of Buckingham. The members of that family, I repeat, are loyal
      and discreet, and the rights of hospitality are sure to be respected by
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Duke of Buckingham is an Englishman, madame," said Philip, "and may I
      ask if the English so very religiously respect what belongs to princes of
      France?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne blushed a second time, and turned aside under the pretext of taking
      her pen from her desk again, but in reality to conceal her confusion from
      her son. "Really, Philip," she said, "you seem to discover expressions for
      the purpose of embarrassing me, and your anger blinds you while it alarms
      me; reflect a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no need for reflection, madame. I can see with my own eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, and what do you see?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That Buckingham never quits my wife. He presumes to make presents to her,
      and she ventures to accept them. Yesterday she was talking about <i>sauchets
      a la violette</i>; well, our French perfumers, you know very well, madame,
      for you have over and over again asked for it without success&mdash;our
      French perfumers, I say, have never been able to procure this scent. The
      duke, however, wore about him a <i>sachet a la violette</i>, and I am sure
      that the one my wife has came from him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, monsieur," said Anne of Austria, "you build your pyramids on
      needle points; be careful. What harm, I ask you, can there be in a man
      giving to his countrywoman a recipe for a new essence? These strange
      ideas, I protest, painfully recall your father to me; he who so frequently
      and so unjustly made me suffer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Duke of Buckingham's father was probably more reserved and more
      respectful than his son," said Philip, thoughtlessly, not perceiving how
      deeply he had wounded his mother's feelings. The queen turned pale, and
      pressed her clenched hands upon her bosom; but, recovering herself
      immediately, she said, "You came here with some intention or another, I
      suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came, madame, intending to complain energetically, and to inform you
      that I will not submit to such behavior from the Duke of Buckingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you intend to do, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall complain to the king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what do you expect the king to reply?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then," said Monsieur, with an expression of stern
      determination on his countenance, which offered a singular contrast to its
      usual gentleness. "Very well. I will right myself!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you call righting yourself?" inquired Anne of Austria, in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will have the Duke of Buckingham quit the princess, I will have him
      quit France, and I will see that my wishes are intimated to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will intimate nothing of the kind, Philip," said the queen, "for if
      you act in that manner, and violate hospitality to that extent, I will
      invoke the severity of the king against you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you threaten me, madame?" exclaimed Philip, almost in tears; "do you
      threaten me in the midst of my complaints?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not threaten you; I do but place an obstacle in the path of your
      hasty anger. I maintain, that, to adopt towards the Duke of Buckingham, or
      any other Englishman, any rigorous measure&mdash;to take even a
      discourteous step towards him, would be to plunge France and England into
      the most disastrous disagreement. Can it be possible that a prince of the
      blood, the brother of the king of France, does not know how to hide an
      injury, even did it exist in reality, where political necessity requires
      it?" Philip made a movement. "Besides," continued the queen, "the injury
      is neither true nor possible, and it is merely a matter of silly
      jealousy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, I know what I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever you may know, I can only advise you to be patient."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not patient by disposition, madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen rose, full of severity, and with an icy ceremonious manner.
      "Explain what you really require, monsieur," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not require anything, madame; I simply express what I desire. If the
      Duke of Buckingham does not, of his own accord, discontinue his visits to
      my apartments I shall forbid him entrance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a point you will refer to the king," said Anne of Austria, her
      heart swelling as she spoke, and her voice trembling with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, madame," exclaimed Philip, striking his hands together, "act as my
      mother and not as the queen, since I speak to you as a son; it is simply a
      matter of a few minutes' conversation between the duke and myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is that very conversation I forbid," said the queen, resuming her
      authority, "because it is unworthy of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so; I will not appear in the matter, but I shall intimate my will
      to Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said the queen-mother, with a melancholy arising from reflection,
      "never tyrannize over a wife&mdash;never behave too haughtily or
      imperiously towards your own. A woman unwillingly convinced, is
      unconvinced."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is to be done, then?&mdash;I will consult my friends about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, your double-dealing advisers, your Chevalier de Lorraine&mdash;your
      De Wardes. Intrust the conduct of this affair to me. You wish the Duke of
      Buckingham to leave, do you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As soon as possible, madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send the duke to me, then; smile upon your wife, behave to her, to the
      king, to every one, as usual. But follow no advice but mine. Alas! I too
      well know what any household comes to, that is troubled by advisers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall be obeyed, madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you will be satisfied at the result. Send the duke to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will not be difficult."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do you suppose him to be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At my wife's door, whose <i>levee</i> he is probably awaiting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said Anne of Austria, calmly. "Be good enough to tell the
      duke that I shall be charmed if he will pay me a visit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip kissed his mother's hand, and started off to find the Duke of
      Buckingham.

    <h2>
      Chapter XVII. Forever!
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Duke of Buckingham, obedient to the queen-mother's invitation,
      presented himself in her apartments half an hour after the departure of
      the Duc d'Orleans. When his name was announced by the gentleman-usher in
      attendance, the queen, who was sitting with her elbow resting on a table,
      and her head buried in her hands, rose, and smilingly received the
      graceful and respectful salutation which the duke addressed to her. Anne
      of Austria was still beautiful. It is well known that at her then somewhat
      advanced age, her long auburn hair, perfectly formed hands, and bright
      ruby lips, were still the admiration of all who saw her. On the present
      occasion, abandoned entirely to a remembrance which evoked all the past in
      her heart, she looked almost as beautiful as in the days of her youth,
      when her palace was open to the visits of the Duke of Buckingham's father,
      then a young and impassioned man, as well as an unfortunate prince, who
      lived for her alone, and died with her name upon his lips. Anne of Austria
      fixed upon Buckingham a look so tender in its expression, that it denoted,
      not alone the indulgence of maternal affection, but a gentleness of
      expression like the coquetry of a woman who loves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty," said Buckingham, respectfully, "desired to speak to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, duke," said the queen, in English; "will you be good enough to sit
      down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The favor which Anne of Austria thus extended to the young man, and the
      welcome sound of the language of a country from which the duke had been
      estranged since his stay in France, deeply affected him. He immediately
      conjectured that the queen had a request to make of him. After having
      abandoned the first few moments to the irrepressible emotions she
      experienced, the queen resumed the smiling air with which she had received
      him. "What do you think of France?" she said, in French.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a lovely country, madame," replied the duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had you ever seen it before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once only, madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, like all true Englishmen, you prefer England?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I prefer my own native land to France," replied the duke; "but if your
      majesty were to ask me which of the two cities, London or Pairs, I should
      prefer as a residence, I should be forced to answer Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Austria observed the ardent manner with which these words had been
      pronounced. "I am told, my lord, you have rich possessions in your own
      country, and that you live in a splendid and time-honored place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was my father's residence," replied Buckingham, casting down his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those are indeed great advantages and <i>souvenirs</i>," replied the
      queen, alluding, in spite of herself, to recollections from which it is
      impossible voluntarily to detach one's self.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In fact," said the duke, yielding to the melancholy influence of this
      opening conversation, "sensitive persons live as much in the past or the
      future, as in the present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is very true," said the queen, in a low tone of voice. "It follows,
      then, my lord," she added, "that you, who are a man of feeling, will soon
      quit France in order to shut yourself up with your wealth and your relics
      of the past."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham raised his head and said, "I think not, madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, I think of leaving England in order to take up my
      residence in France."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now Anne of Austria's turn to exhibit surprise. "Why?" she said.
      "Are you not in favor with the new king?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly so, madame, for his majesty's kindness to me is unbounded."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It cannot," said the queen, "be because your fortune has diminished, for
      it is said to be enormous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My income, madame, has never been so large."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is some secret cause, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madame," said Buckingham, eagerly, "there is nothing secret in my
      reason for this determination. I prefer residence in France; I like a
      court so distinguished by its refinement and courtesy; I like the
      amusements, somewhat serious in their nature, which are not the amusements
      of my own country, and which are met with in France."
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Austria smiled shrewdly. "Amusements of a serious nature?" she
      said. "Has your Grace well reflected on their seriousness?" The duke
      hesitated. "There is no amusement so serious," continued the queen, "as to
      prevent a man of your rank&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty seems to insist greatly on that point," interrupted the
      duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think so, my lord?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will forgive me for saying so, it is the second time you have
      vaunted the attractions of England at the expense of the delight which all
      experience who live in France."
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Austria approached the young man, and placing her beautiful hand
      upon his shoulder, which trembled at the touch, said, "Believe me,
      monsieur, nothing can equal a residence in one's own native country. I
      have very frequently had occasion to regret Spain. I have lived long, my
      lord, very long for a woman, and I confess to you, that not a year has
      passed I have not regretted Spain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not one year, madame?" said the young duke coldly. "Not one of those
      years when you reigned Queen of Beauty&mdash;as you still are, indeed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A truce to flattery, duke, for I am old enough to be your mother." She
      emphasized these latter words in a manner, and with a gentleness, which
      penetrated Buckingham's heart. "Yes," she said, "I am old enough to be
      your mother; and for this reason, I will give you a word of advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That advice being that I should return to London?" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke clasped his hands with a terrified gesture, which could not fail
      of its effect upon the queen, already disposed to softer feelings by the
      tenderness of her own recollections. "It must be so," added the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" he again exclaimed, "am I seriously told that I must leave,&mdash;that
      I must exile myself,&mdash;that I am to flee at once?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exile yourself, did you say? One would fancy France was your native
      country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, the country of those who love is the country of those whom they
      love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not another word, my lord; you forget whom you are addressing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham threw himself on his knees. "Madame, you are the source of
      intelligence, of goodness, and of compassion; you are the first person in
      this kingdom, not only by your rank, but the first person in the world on
      account of your angelic attributes. I have said nothing, madame. Have I,
      indeed, said anything you should answer with such a cruel remark? What
      have I betrayed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have betrayed yourself," said the queen, in a low tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have said nothing,&mdash;I know nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget you have spoken and thought in the presence of a woman; and
      besides&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides," said the duke, "no one knows you are listening to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, it is known; you have all the defects and all the
      qualities of youth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been betrayed or denounced, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By those who, at Le Havre, had, with infernal perspicacity, read my heart
      like an open book."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know whom you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Bragelonne, for instance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know the name without being acquainted with the person to whom it
      belongs. M. de Bragelonne has said nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can it be, then? If any one, madame, had had the boldness to notice
      in me that which I do not myself wish to behold&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you do, duke?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are secrets which kill those who discover them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He, then, who has discovered your secret, madman that you are, still
      lives; and, what is more, you will not slay him, for he is armed on all
      sides,&mdash;he is a husband, a jealous man,&mdash;he is the second
      gentleman in France,&mdash;he is my son, the Duc du Orleans."
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke turned pale as death. "You are very cruel, madame," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, Buckingham," said Anne of Austria, sadly, "how you pass from one
      extreme to another, and fight with shadows, when it would seem so easy to
      remain at peace with yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If we fight, madame, we die on the field of battle," replied the young
      man, gently, abandoning himself to the most gloomy depression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne ran towards him and took him by the hand. "Villiers," she said, in
      English, with a vehemence of tone which nothing could resist, "what is it
      you ask? Do you ask a mother to sacrifice her son,&mdash;a queen to
      consent to the dishonor of her house? Child that you are, do not dream of
      it. What! in order to spare your tears am I to commit these crimes?
      Villiers! you speak of the dead; the dead, at least, were full of respect
      and submission; they resigned themselves to an order of exile; they
      carried their despair away with them in their hearts, like a priceless
      possession, because the despair was caused by the woman they loved, and
      because death, thus deceptive, was like a gift of a favor conferred upon
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham rose, his features distorted, and his hands pressed against his
      heart. "You are right, madame," he said, "but those of whom you speak had
      received their order of exile from the lips of the one whom they loved;
      they were not driven away; they were entreated to leave, and were not
      laughed at."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," murmured Anne of Austria, "they were not forgotten. But who says you
      are driven away, or that you are exiled? Who says that your devotion will
      not be remembered? I do not speak on any one's behalf but my own, when I
      tell you to leave. Do me this kindness,&mdash;grant me this favor; let me,
      for this also, be indebted to one of your name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is for your sake, then, madame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For mine alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one whom I shall leave behind me will venture to mock,&mdash;no prince
      even who shall say, 'I required it.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me, duke," and hereupon the dignified features of the queen
      assumed a solemn expression. "I swear to you that no one commands in this
      matter but myself. I swear to you that, not only shall no one either laugh
      or boast in any way, but no one even shall fail in the respect due to your
      rank. Rely upon me, duke, as I rely upon you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not explain yourself, madame; my heart is full of bitterness, and
      I am in utter despair; no consolation, however gentle and affectionate,
      can afford me relief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remember your mother, duke?" replied the queen, with a winning
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very slightly, madame; yet I remember how she used to cover me with her
      caresses and her tears whenever I wept."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Villiers," murmured the queen, passing her arm round the young man's
      neck, "look upon me as your mother, and believe that no one shall ever
      make my son weep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you, madame," said the young man affected and almost suffocated
      by his emotion; "I feel there is still room in my heart for a gentler and
      nobler sentiment than love."
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen-mother looked at him and pressed his hand. "Go," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When must I leave? Command me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At any time that may suit you, my lord," resumed the queen; "you will
      choose your own day of departure. Instead, however, of setting off to-day,
      as you would doubtless wish to do, or to-morrow, as others may have
      expected, leave the day after to-morrow, in the evening; but announce
      to-day that it is your wish to leave."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wish?" murmured the young duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, duke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And shall I never return to France?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Austria reflected for a moment, seemingly absorbed in sad and
      serious thought. "It would be a consolation for me," she said, "if you
      were to return on the day when I shall be carried to my final
      resting-place at Saint-Dennis beside the king, my husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, you are goodness itself; the tide of prosperity is setting in on
      you; your cup brims over with happiness, and many long years are yet
      before you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case you will not come for some time, then," said the queen,
      endeavoring to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall not return," said Buckingham, "young as I am. Death does not
      reckon by years; it is impartial; some die young, some reach old age."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not harbor any sorrowful ideas, duke. Let me comfort you; return
      in two years. I perceive from your face that the very idea which saddens
      you so much now, will have disappeared before six months have passed, and
      will be not only dead but forgotten in the period of absence I have
      assigned you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you judged me better a little while ago, madame," replied the
      young man, "when you said that time is powerless against members of the
      family of Buckingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silence," said the queen, kissing the duke upon the forehead with an
      affection she could not restrain. "Go, go; spare me and forget yourself no
      longer. I am the queen; you are the subject of the king of England; King
      Charles awaits your return. Adieu, Villiers,&mdash;farewell."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forever!" replied the young man, and he fled, endeavoring to master his
      emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne leaned her head upon her hands, and then looking at herself in the
      glass, murmured, "It has been truly said, that a woman who has truly loved
      is always young, and that the bloom of the girl of twenty years ever lies
      concealed in some secret cloister of the heart." <a href="#linknote-1"

      Chapter XVIII. King Louis XIV. does not think Mademoiselle de la Valliere
      either rich enough or pretty enough for a Gentleman of the Rank of the
      Vicomte de Bragelonne.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Raoul and the Comte de la Fere reached Paris the evening of the same day
      on which Buckingham had held the conversation with the queen-mother. The
      count had scarcely arrived, when, through Raoul, he solicited an audience
      of the king. His majesty had passed a portion of the morning in looking
      over, with madame and the ladies of the court, various goods of Lyons
      manufacture, of which he had made his sister-in-law a present. A court
      dinner had succeeded, then cards, and afterwards, according to his usual
      custom, the king, leaving the card-tables at eight o'clock, passed into
      his cabinet in order to work with M. Colbert and M. Fouquet. Raoul entered
      the ante-chamber at the very moment the two ministers quitted it, and the
      king, perceiving him through the half-closed door, said, "What do you
      want, M. de Bragelonne?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man approached: "An audience, sire," he replied, "for the Comte
      de la Fere, who has just arrived from Blois, and is most anxious to have
      an interview with your majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have an hour to spare between cards and supper," said the king. "Is the
      Comte de la Fere at hand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is below, and awaits your majesty's permission."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him come up at once," said the king, and five minutes afterwards
      Athos entered the presence of Louis XIV. He was received by the king with
      that gracious kindness of manner which Louis, with a tact beyond his
      years, reserved for the purpose of gaining those who were not to be
      conquered by ordinary favors. "Let me hope, comte," said the king, "that
      you have come to ask me for something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not conceal from your majesty," replied the comte, "that I am
      indeed come for that purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is well," said the king, joyously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not for myself, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the worse; but, at least, I will do for your <i>protege</i> what
      you refuse to permit me to do for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty encourages me. I have come to speak on behalf of the Vicomte
      de Bragelonne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the same as if you spoke on your own behalf, comte."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not altogether so, sire. I am desirous of obtaining from your majesty
      that which I cannot ask for myself. The vicomte thinks of marrying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is still very young; but that does not matter. He is an eminently
      distinguished man; I will choose a wife for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has already chosen one, sire, and only awaits your consent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is only a question, then, of signing the marriage-contract?" Athos
      bowed. "Has he chose a wife whose fortune and position accord with your
      own anticipation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Athos hesitated for a moment. "His affirmed wife is of good birth, but has
      no fortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a misfortune we can remedy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You overwhelm me with gratitude, sire; but your majesty will permit me to
      offer a remark?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so, comte."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty seems to intimate an intention of giving a marriage-portion
      to this young lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should regret, sire, if the step I have taken towards your majesty
      should be attended by this result."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No false delicacy, comte; what is the bride's name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle de la Baume le Blanc de la Valliere," said Athos, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I seem to know that name," said the king, as if reflecting; "there was a
      Marquis de la Valliere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire, it is his daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he died, and his widow married again M. de Saint-Remy, I think,
      steward of the dowager Madame's household."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty is correctly informed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than that, the young lady has lately become one of the princess's
      maids of honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty is better acquainted with her history than am I."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king again reflected, and glancing at the comte's anxious countenance,
      said: "The young lady does not seem to me to be very pretty, comte."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not quite sure," replied Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have seen her, but she hardly struck me as being so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She seems to be a good and modest girl, but has little beauty, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beautiful fair hair, however."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And her blue eyes are tolerably good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With regard to her beauty, then, the match is but an ordinary one. Now
      for the money side of the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fifteen to twenty thousand francs dowry at the very outset, sire; the
      lovers are disinterested enough; for myself, I care little for money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For superfluity, you mean; but a needful amount is of importance. With
      fifteen thousand francs, without landed property, a woman cannot live at
      court. We will make up the deficiency; I will do it for De Bragelonne."
      The king again remarked the coldness with which Athos received the remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us pass from the question of money to that of rank," said Louis XIV.;
      "the daughter of the Marquis de la Valliere, that is well enough; but
      there is that excellent Saint-Remy, who somewhat damages the credit of the
      family; and you, comte, are rather particular, I believe, about your own
      family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, I no longer hold to anything but my devotion to your majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king again paused. "A moment, comte. You have surprised me in no
      little degree from the beginning of your conversation. You came to ask me
      to authorize a marriage, and you seem greatly disturbed in having to make
      the request. Nay, pardon me, comte, but I am rarely deceived, young as I
      am; for while with some persons I place my friendship at the disposal of
      my understanding, with others I call my distrust to my aid, by which my
      discernment is increased. I repeat, that you do not prefer your request as
      though you wished it success."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sire, that is true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not understand you, then; refuse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, sire; I love De Bragelonne with my whole heart; he is smitten with
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere, he weaves dreams of bliss for the future; I
      am not one who is willing to destroy the illusions of youth. This marriage
      is objectionable to me, but I implore your majesty to consent to it
      forthwith, and thus make Raoul happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, comte, is she in love with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If your majesty requires me to speak candidly, I do not believe in
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere's affection; the delight at being at court,
      the honor of being in the service of Madame, counteract in her head
      whatever affection she may happen to have in her heart; it is a marriage
      similar to many others which already exist at court; but De Bragelonne
      wishes it, and so let it be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet you do not resemble those easy-tempered fathers who volunteer as
      stepping-stones for their children," said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am determined enough against the viciously disposed, but not so against
      men of upright character. Raoul is suffering; he is in great distress of
      mind; his disposition, naturally light and cheerful, has become gloomy and
      melancholy. I do not wish to deprive your majesty of the services he may
      be able to render."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand you," said the king; "and what is more, I understand your
      heart, too, comte."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no occasion, therefore," replied the comte, "to tell your
      majesty that my object is to make these children, or rather Raoul, happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I, too, as much as yourself, comte, wish to secure M. de Bragelonne's
      happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only await your majesty's signature. Raoul will have the honor of
      presenting himself before your majesty to receive your consent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are mistaken, comte," said the king, firmly; "I have just said that I
      desire to secure M. de Bragelonne's happiness, and from the present
      moment, therefore, I oppose his marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, sire," exclaimed Athos, "your majesty has promised!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so, comte, I did not promise you, for it is opposed to my own views."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I appreciate your majesty's considerate and generous intentions on my
      behalf; but I take the liberty of recalling to you that I undertook to
      approach you as an ambassador."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An ambassador, comte, frequently asks, but does not always obtain what he
      asks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, sire, it will be such a blow for De Bragelonne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My hand shall deal the blow; I will speak to the vicomte."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love, sire, is overwhelming in its might."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love can be resisted, comte. I myself can assure you of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When one has the soul of a king,&mdash;your own, for instance, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not make yourself uneasy on the subject. I have certain views for De
      Bragelonne. I do not say that he shall not marry Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere, but I do not wish him to marry so young; I do not wish him to
      marry her until she has acquired a fortune; and he, on his side, no less
      deserves favor, such as I wish to confer upon him. In a word, comte, I
      wish them to wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet once more, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comte, you told me you came here to request a favor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assuredly, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Grant me one, then, instead; let us speak no longer upon this matter. It
      is probable that, before long, war may be declared. I require men about me
      who are unfettered. I should hesitate to send under fire a married man, or
      a father of a family. I should hesitate also, on De Bragelonne's account,
      to endow with a fortune, without some sound reason for it, a young girl, a
      perfect stranger; such an act would sow jealousy amongst my nobility."
      Athos bowed, and remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that all you wished to ask me?" added Louis XIV.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely all, sire; and I take my leave of your majesty. Is it,
      however, necessary that I should inform Raoul?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spare yourself the trouble and annoyance. Tell the vicomte that at my <i>levee</i>
      to-morrow morning I will speak to him. I shall expect you this evening,
      comte, to join my card-table."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am in traveling-costume, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A day will come, I hope, when you will leave me no more. Before long,
      comte, the monarchy will be established in such a manner as to enable me
      to offer a worthy hospitality to men of your merit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Provided, sire, a monarch reigns grandly in the hearts of his subjects,
      the palace he inhabits matters little, since he is worshipped in a
      temple." With these words Athos left the cabinet, and found De Bragelonne,
      who was awaiting him anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, monsieur?" said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king, Raoul, is well intentioned towards us both; not, perhaps, in
      the sense you suppose, but he is kind, and generously disposed to our
      house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have bad news to communicate to me, monsieur," said the young man,
      turning very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king himself will inform you to-morrow morning that it is not bad
      news."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king has not signed, however?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king wishes himself to settle the terms of the contract, and he
      desires to make it so grand that he requires time for consideration. Throw
      the blame rather on your own impatience, than on the king's good feelings
      towards you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul, in utter consternation, on account of his knowledge of the count's
      frankness as well as his diplomacy, remained plunged in dull and gloomy
      stupor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you not go with me to my lodgings?" said Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, monsieur; I will follow you," he stammered out,
      following Athos down the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since I am here," said Athos, suddenly, "cannot I see M. d'Artagnan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I show you his apartments?" said De Bragelonne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are on the opposite staircase."
    </p>
    <p>
      They altered their course, but on reaching the landing of the grand
      staircase, Raoul perceived a servant in the Comte de Guiche's livery, who
      ran towards him as soon as he heard his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This note, monsieur. My master heard of your return and wrote to you
      without delay; I have been looking for you for the last half-hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul approached Athos as he unsealed the letter, saying, "With your
      permission, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Raoul," wrote the Comte de Guiche, "I have an affair in hand which
      requires immediate attention; I know you have returned; come to me as soon
      as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had he finished reading it, when a servant in the livery of the
      Duke of Buckingham, turning out of the gallery, recognized Raoul, and
      approached him respectfully, saying, "From his Grace, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Raoul, as I see you are already as busy as a general of an army, I
      shall leave you, and will find M. d'Artagnan myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will excuse me, I trust," said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, I excuse you; adieu, Raoul; you will find me at my apartments
      until to-morrow; during the day I may set out for Blois, unless I have
      orders to the contrary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall present my respects to you to-morrow, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Athos had left, Raoul opened Buckingham's letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur de Bragelonne," it ran, "You are, of all the Frenchmen I have
      known, the one with whom I am most pleased; I am about to put your
      friendship to the proof. I have received a certain message, written in
      very good French. As I am an Englishman, I am afraid of not comprehending
      it very clearly. The letter has a good name attached to it, and that is
      all I can tell you. Will you be good enough to come and see me? for I am
      told you have arrived from Blois.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your devoted
    </p>
    <p>
      "VILLIERS, Duke of Buckingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going now to see your master," said Raoul to De Guiche's servant, as
      he dismissed him; "and I shall be with the Duke of Buckingham in an hour,"
      he added, dismissing with these words the duke's messenger.

    <h2>
      Chapter XIX. Sword-Thrusts in the Water.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Raoul, on betaking himself to De Guiche, found him conversing with De
      Wardes and Manicamp. De Wardes, since the affair of the barricade, had
      treated Raoul as a stranger; they behaved as if they were not acquainted.
      As Raoul entered, De Guiche walked up to him; and Raoul, as he grasped his
      friend's hand, glanced rapidly at his two companions, hoping to be able to
      read on their faces what was passing in their minds. De Wardes was cold
      and impenetrable; Manicamp seemed absorbed in the contemplation of some
      trimming to his dress. De Guiche led Raoul to an adjoining cabinet, and
      made him sit down, saying, "How well you look!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is singular," replied Raoul, "for I am far from being in good
      spirits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is your case, then, Raoul, as it is my own,&mdash;our love affairs do
      not progress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the better, count, as far as <i>you</i> are concerned; the worst
      news would be good news."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case do not distress yourself, for, not only am I very unhappy,
      but, what is more, I see others about me who are happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, I do not understand you," replied Raoul; "explain yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will soon learn. I have tried, but in vain, to overcome the feeling
      you saw dawn in me, increase, and take entire possession of me. I have
      summoned all your advice and my own strength to my aid. I have well
      weighed the unfortunate affair in which I have embarked; I have sounded
      its depths; that it is an abyss, I am aware, but it matters little for <i>I</i>
      shall pursue my own course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is madness, De Guiche! you cannot advance another step without
      risking your own ruin to-day, perhaps your life to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever may happen, I have done with reflections; listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you hope to succeed; you believe that Madame will love you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Raoul, I believe nothing; I hope, because hope exists in man, and never
      abandons him until death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, admitting that you obtain the happiness you covet, even then, you
      are more certainly lost than if you had failed in obtaining it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beseech you, Raoul, not to interrupt me any more; you could never
      convince me, for I tell you beforehand, I do not wish to be convinced; I
      have gone so far I cannot recede; I have suffered so much, death itself
      would be a boon. I no longer love to madness, Raoul, I am being engulfed
      by a whirlpool of jealousy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul struck his hands together with an expression resembling anger.
      "Well?" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well or ill matters little. This is what I claim from you, my friend, my
      almost brother. During the last three days Madame has been living in a
      perfect intoxication of gayety. On the first day, I dared not look at her;
      I hated her for not being as unhappy as myself. The next day I could not
      bear her out of my sight; and she, Raoul&mdash;at least I thought I
      remarked it&mdash;she looked at me, if not with pity, at least with
      gentleness. But between her looks and mine, a shadow intervened; another's
      smile invited hers. Beside her horse another's always gallops, which is
      not mine; in her ear another's caressing voice, not mine, unceasingly
      vibrates. Raoul, for three days past my brain has been on fire; flame, not
      blood, courses through my veins. That shadow must be driven away, that
      smile must be quenched; that voice must be silenced."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wish Monsieur's death," exclaimed Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, I am not jealous of the husband; I am jealous of the lover."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the lover?" said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you not observed it, you who were formerly so keen-sighted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you jealous of the Duke of Buckingham?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the very death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Again jealous?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This time the affair will be easy to arrange between us; I have taken the
      initiative, and have sent him a letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was you, then, who wrote to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it, because he told me so. Look at this;" and he handed De Guiche
      the letter he had received nearly at the same moment as his own. De Guiche
      read it eagerly, and said, "He is a brave man, and more than that, a
      gallant man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most certainly the duke is a gallant man; I need not ask if you wrote to
      him in a similar style."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will show you my letter when you call on him on my behalf."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that is almost out of the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I shall call on him for that purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The duke consults me as you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you will give <i>me</i> the preference! Listen to me, Raoul, I
      wish you to tell his Grace&mdash;it is a very simple matter&mdash;that
      to-day, to-morrow, the following day, or any other day he may choose, I
      will meet him at Vincennes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reflect, De Guiche."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I told you I have reflected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The duke is a stranger here; he is on a mission which renders his person
      inviolable.... Vincennes is close to the Bastile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The consequences concern <i>me</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the motive for this meeting? What motive do you wish me to assign?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be perfectly easy on that score, he will not ask any. The duke must be as
      sick of me as I am of him. I implore you, therefore, seek the duke, and if
      it is necessary to entreat him, to accept my offer, I will do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is useless. The duke has already informed me that he wishes to speak
      to me. The duke is now playing cards with the king. Let us both go there.
      I will draw him aside in the gallery; you will remain aloof. Two words
      will be sufficient."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is well arranged. I will take De Wardes to keep me in countenance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not Manicamp? De Wardes can join us at any time; we can leave him
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that is true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He knows nothing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Positively nothing. You continue still on an unfriendly footing, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he not told you anything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not like the man, and, as I <i>never</i> liked him, the result is,
      that I am on no worse terms with him to-day than I was yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us go, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      The four descended the stairs. De Guiche's carriage was waiting at the
      door, and took them to the Palais Royal. As they were going along, Raoul
      was engaged in devising his scheme of action. The sole depositary of two
      secrets, he did not despair of concluding some arrangement between the two
      parties. He knew the influence he exercised over Buckingham, and the
      ascendency he had acquired over De Guiche, and affairs did not look
      utterly hopeless. On their arrival in the gallery, dazzling with the blaze
      of light, where the most beautiful and illustrious women of the court
      moved to and fro, like stars in their own atmosphere, Raoul could not
      prevent himself for a moment forgetting De Guiche in order to seek out
      Louise, who, amidst her companions, like a dove completely fascinated,
      gazed long and fixedly upon the royal circle, which glittered with jewels
      and gold. All its members were standing, the king alone being seated.
      Raoul perceived Buckingham, who was standing a few paces from Monsieur, in
      a group of French and English, who were admiring his aristocratic carriage
      and the incomparable magnificence of his costume. Some of the older
      courtiers remembered having seen his father, but their recollections were
      not prejudicial to the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham was conversing with Fouquet, who was talking with him aloud
      about Belle-Isle. "I cannot speak to him at present," said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait, then, and choose your opportunity, but finish everything speedily.
      I am on thorns."
    </p>
    <p>
      "See, our deliverer approaches," said Raoul, perceiving D'Artagnan, who,
      magnificently dressed in his new uniform of captain of the musketeers, had
      just made his entry in the gallery; and he advanced towards D'Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Comte de la Fere has been looking for you, chevalier," said Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied D'Artagnan, "I have just left him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you would have passed a portion of the evening together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have arranged to meet again."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he answered Raoul, his absent looks were directed on all sides, as if
      seeking some one in the crowd or looking for something in the room.
      Suddenly his gaze became fixed, like that of an eagle on its prey. Raoul
      followed the direction of his glance, and noticed that De Guiche and
      D'Artagnan saluted each other, but he could not distinguish at whom the
      captain's lingering and haughty glance was aimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chevalier," said Raoul, "there is no one here but yourself who can render
      me a service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, my dear vicomte?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is simply to go and interrupt the Duke of Buckingham, to whom I wish
      to say two words, and, as the duke is conversing with M. Fouquet, you
      understand that it would not do for <i>me</i> to throw myself into the
      middle of the conversation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, ah, is M. Fouquet there?" inquired D'Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not see him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, now I do. But do you think I have a greater right than you have?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a more important personage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you're right; I am captain of the musketeers; I have had the post
      promised me so long, and have enjoyed it for so brief a period, that I am
      always forgetting my dignity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will do me this service, will you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. Fouquet&mdash;the deuce!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you not on good terms with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is rather he who may not be on good terms with me; however, since it
      must be done some day or another&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay; I think he is looking at you; or is it likely that it might be&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; don't deceive yourself, it is indeed me for whom this honor is
      intended."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The opportunity is a good one, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche had not removed his eyes from Raoul, who made a sign to him that
      all was arranged. D'Artagnan walked straight up to the group, and civilly
      saluted M. Fouquet as well as the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening, M. d'Artagnan; we were speaking of Belle-Isle," said
      Fouquet, with that usage of society, and that perfect knowledge of the
      language of looks, which require half a lifetime thoroughly to acquire,
      and which some persons, notwithstanding all their study, never attain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of Belle-Ile-en-Mer! Ah!" said D'Artagnan. "It belongs to you, I believe,
      M. Fouquet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. Fouquet has just told us that he had presented it to the king," said
      Buckingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know Belle-Isle, chevalier?" inquired Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have only been there once," replied D'Artagnan, with readiness and
      good-humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you remain there long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scarcely a day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you see much of it while you were there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that could be seen in a day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A great deal can be seen with observation as keen as yours," said
      Fouquet; at which D'Artagnan bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this Raoul made a sign to Buckingham. "M. Fouquet," said
      Buckingham, "I leave the captain with you, he is more learned than I am in
      bastions, scarps, and counter-scarps, and I will join one of my friends,
      who has just beckoned me." Saying this, Buckingham disengaged himself from
      the group, and advanced towards Raoul, stopping for a moment at the table
      where the queen-mother, the young queen, and the king were playing
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Raoul," said De Guiche, "there he is; be firm and quick."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham, having made some complimentary remark to Madame, continued his
      way towards Raoul, who advanced to meet him, while De Guiche remained in
      his place, though he followed him with his eyes. The maneuver was so
      arranged that the young men met in an open space which was left vacant,
      between the groups of players and the gallery, where they walked, stopping
      now and then for the purpose of saying a few words to some of the graver
      courtiers who were walking there. At the moment when the two lines were
      about to unite, they were broken by a third. It was Monsieur who advanced
      towards the Duke of Buckingham. Monsieur had his most engaging smile on
      his red and perfumed lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear duke," said he, with the most affectionate politeness; "is it
      really true what I have just been told?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham turned round; he had not noticed Monsieur approach; but had
      merely heard his voice. He started in spite of his command over himself,
      and a slight pallor overspread his face. "Monseigneur," he asked, "what
      has been told you that surprises you so much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That which throws me into despair, and will, in truth, be a real cause of
      mourning for the whole court."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness is very kind, for I perceive that you allude to my
      departure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely."
    </p>
    <p>
      Guiche had overheard the conversation from where he was standing, and
      started in his turn. "His departure," he murmured. "What does he say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip continued with the same gracious air, "I can easily conceive,
      monsieur, why the king of Great Britain recalls you; we all know that King
      Charles II., who appreciates true gentlemen, cannot dispense with you. But
      it cannot be supposed we can let you go without great regret; and I beg
      you to receive the expression of my own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe me, monseigneur," said the duke, "that if I quit the court of
      France&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because you are recalled; but, if you suppose the expression of my own
      wish on the subject might possibly have any influence with the king, I
      will gladly volunteer to entreat his majesty Charles II. to leave you with
      us a little while longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am overwhelmed, monseigneur, by so much kindness," replied Buckingham;
      "but I have received positive commands. My residence in France was
      limited; I have prolonged it at the risk of displeasing my gracious
      sovereign. It is only this very day that I recollected I ought to have set
      off four days ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed," said Monsieur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but," added Buckingham, raising his voice in such a manner that the
      princess could hear him,&mdash;"but I resemble that dweller in the East,
      who turned mad, and remained so for several days, owing to a delightful
      dream that he had had, but who one day awoke, if not completely cured, in
      some respects rational at least. The court of France has its intoxicating
      properties, which are not unlike this dream, my lord; but at last I wake
      and leave it. I shall be unable, therefore, to prolong my residence, as
      your highness has so kindly invited me to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When do you leave?" inquired Philip, with an expression full of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow, monseigneur. My carriages have been ready for three days."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duc d'Orleans made a movement of the head, which seemed to signify,
      "Since you are determined, duke, there is nothing to be said." Buckingham
      returned the gesture, concealing under a smile a contraction of his heart;
      and then Monsieur moved away in the same direction by which he had
      approached. At the same moment, however, De Guiche advanced from the
      opposite direction. Raoul feared that the impatient young man might
      possibly make the proposition himself, and hurried forth before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, Raoul, all is useless now," said Guiche, holding both his hands
      towards the duke, and leading him behind a column. "Forgive me, duke, for
      what I wrote to you, I was mad; give me back my letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true," said the duke, "you cannot owe me a grudge any longer now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, duke; my friendship, my lasting friendship is yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is certainly no reason why you should bear me any ill-will from the
      moment I leave her never to see her again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul heard these words, and comprehending that his presence was now
      useless between the young men, who had now only friendly words to
      exchange, withdrew a few paces; a movement which brought him closer to De
      Wardes, who was conversing with the Chevalier de Lorraine respecting the
      departure of Buckingham. "A strategic retreat," said De Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because the dear duke saves a sword-thrust by it." At which reply both
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul, indignant, turned round frowningly, flushed with anger and his lip
      curling with disdain. The Chevalier de Lorraine turned on his heel, but De
      Wardes remained and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not break yourself of the habit," said Raoul to De Wardes, "of
      insulting the absent; yesterday it was M. d'Artagnan, to-day it is the
      Duke of Buckingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know very well, monsieur," returned De Wardes, "that I sometimes
      insult those who are present."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes was close to Raoul, their shoulders met, their faces approached,
      as if to mutually inflame each other by the fire of their looks and of
      their anger. It could be seen that the one was at the height of fury, the
      other at the end of his patience. Suddenly a voice was heard behind them
      full of grace and courtesy, saying, "I believe I heard my name
      pronounced."
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned round and saw D'Artagnan, who, with a smiling eye and a
      cheerful face, had just placed his hand on De Wardes's shoulder. Raoul
      stepped back to make room for the musketeer. De Wardes trembled from head
      to foot, turned pale, but did not move. D'Artagnan, still with the same
      smile, took the place which Raoul had abandoned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my dear Raoul," he said. "M. de Wardes, I wish to talk with
      you. Do not leave us, Raoul; every one can hear what I have to say to M.
      de Wardes." His smile immediately faded away, and his glace became cold
      and sharp as a sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am at your orders, monsieur," said De Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For a very long time," resumed D'Artagnan, "I have sought an opportunity
      of conversing with you; to-day is the first time I have found it. The
      place is badly chosen, I admit, but you will perhaps have the goodness to
      accompany me to my apartments, which are on the staircase at the end of
      this gallery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I follow you, monsieur," said De Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you alone here?" said D'Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I have M. Manicamp and M. de Guiche, two of my friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's well," said D'Artagnan; "but two persons are not sufficient; you
      will be able to find a few others, I trust."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said the young man, who did not know what object D'Artagnan
      had in view. "As many as you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they friends?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Real friends?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, get a good supply, then. Do you come, too, Raoul; bring M. de
      Guiche and the Duke of Buckingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a disturbance," replied De Wardes, attempting to smile. The captain
      slightly signed to him with his hand, as though to recommend him to be
      patient, and then led the way to his apartments. <a href="#linknote-2"

    <h2>
      Chapter XX. Sword-Thrusts in the Water (concluded).
    </h2>
    <p>
      D'Artagnan's apartment was not unoccupied; for the Comte de la Fere,
      seated in the recess of a window, awaited him. "Well," said he to
      D'Artagnan, as he saw him enter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the latter, "M. de Wardes has done me the honor to pay me a
      visit, in company with some of his own friends, as well as of ours." In
      fact, behind the musketeer appeared De Wardes and Manicamp, followed by De
      Guiche and Buckingham, who looked surprised, not knowing what was expected
      of them. Raoul was accompanied by two or three gentlemen; and, as he
      entered, glanced round the room, and perceiving the count, he went and
      placed himself by his side. D'Artagnan received his visitors with all the
      courtesy he was capable of; he preserved his unmoved and unconcerned look.
      All the persons present were men of distinction, occupying posts of honor
      and credit at the court. After he had apologized to each of them for any
      inconvenience he might have put them to, he turned towards De Wardes, who,
      in spite of his customary self-command, could not prevent his face
      betraying some surprise mingled with not a little uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, monsieur," said D'Artagnan, "since we are no longer within the
      precincts of the king's palace, and since we can speak out without failing
      in respect to propriety, I will inform you why I have taken the liberty to
      request you to visit me here, and why I have invited these gentlemen to be
      present at the same time. My friend, the Comte de la Fere, has acquainted
      me with the injurious reports you are spreading about myself. You have
      stated that you regard me as your mortal enemy, because I was, so you
      affirm, that of your father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly true, monsieur, I have said so," replied De Wardes, whose
      pallid face became slightly tinged with color.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You accuse me, therefore, of a crime, or a fault, or of some mean and
      cowardly act. Have the goodness to state your charge against me in precise
      terms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the presence of witnesses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most certainly in the presence of witnesses; and you see I have selected
      them as being experienced in affairs of honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not appreciate my delicacy, monsieur. I have accused you, it is
      true; but I have kept the nature of the accusation a perfect secret. I
      entered into no details; but have rested satisfied by expressing my hatred
      in the presence of those on whom a duty was almost imposed to acquaint you
      with it. You have not taken the discreetness I have shown into
      consideration, although you were interested in remaining silent. I can
      hardly recognize your habitual prudence in that, M. d'Artagnan."
    </p>
    <p>
      D'Artagnan, who was quietly biting the corner of his moustache, said, "I
      have already had the honor to beg you to state the particulars of the
      grievances you say you have against me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aloud?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, aloud."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, I will speak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak, monsieur," said D'Artagnan, bowing; "we are all listening to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, monsieur, it is not a question of a personal injury towards myself,
      but one towards my father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you have already stated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but there are certain subjects which are only approached with
      hesitation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If that hesitation, in your case, really does exist, I entreat you to
      overcome it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even if it refer to a disgraceful action?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; in every and any case."
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who were present at this scene had, at first, looked at each other
      with a good deal of uneasiness. They were reassured, however, when they
      saw that D'Artagnan manifested no emotion whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes still maintained the same unbroken silence. "Speak, monsieur,"
      said the musketeer; "you see you are keeping us waiting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, then:&mdash;My father loved a lady of noble birth, and this lady
      loved my father." D'Artagnan and Athos exchanged looks. De Wardes
      continued: "M. d'Artagnan found some letters which indicated a rendezvous,
      substituted himself, under disguise, for the person who was expected, and
      took advantage of the darkness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is perfectly true," said D'Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight murmur was heard from those present. "Yes, I was guilty of that
      dishonorable action. You should have added, monsieur, since you are so
      impartial, that, at the period when the circumstance which you have just
      related happened, I was not one-and-twenty years of age."
    </p>
    <p>
      A renewed murmur was heard, but this time of astonishment, and almost of
      doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a most shameful deception, I admit," said D'Artagnan, "and I have
      not waited for M. de Wardes's reproaches to reproach myself for it, and
      very bitterly, too. Age has, however, made me more reasonable, and, above
      all, more upright; and this injury has been atoned for by a long and
      lasting regret. But I appeal to you, gentlemen; this affair took place in
      1626, at a period, happily for yourselves, known to you by tradition only,
      at a period when love was not over-scrupulous, when consciences did not
      distill, as in the present day, poison and bitterness. We were young
      soldiers, always fighting, or being attacked, our swords always in our
      hands, or at least ready to be drawn from their sheaths. Death then always
      stared us in the face, war hardened us, and the cardinal pressed us
      sorely. I have repented of it, and more than that&mdash;I still repent it,
      M. de Wardes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can well understand that, monsieur, for the action itself needed
      repentance; but you were not the less the cause of that lady's disgrace.
      She, of whom you have been speaking, covered with shame, borne down by the
      affront you brought upon her, fled, quitted France, and no one ever knew
      what became of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay," said the Comte de la Fere, stretching his hand towards De Wardes,
      with a peculiar smile upon his face, "you are mistaken; she was seen; and
      there are persons even now present, who, having often heard her spoken of,
      will easily recognize her by the description I am about to give. She was
      about five-and-twenty years of age, slender in form, of a pale complexion,
      and fair-haired; she was married in England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Married?" exclaimed De Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, you were not aware she was married? You see we are far better
      informed than yourself. Do you happen to know she was usually styled 'My
      Lady,' without the addition of any name to that description?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens!" murmured Buckingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, monsieur. That woman, who came from England, returned to
      England after having thrice attempted M. d'Artagnan's life. That was but
      just, you will say, since M. d'Artagnan had insulted her. But that which
      was not just was, that, when in England, this woman, by her seductions,
      completely enslaved a young man in the service of Lord de Winter, by name
      Felton. You change color, my lord," said Athos, turning to the Duke of
      Buckingham, "and your eyes kindle with anger and sorrow. Let your Grace
      finish the recital, then, and tell M. de Wardes who this woman was who
      placed the knife in the hand of your father's murderer."
    </p>
    <p>
      A cry escaped from the lips of all present. The young duke passed his
      handkerchief across his forehead, which was covered with perspiration. A
      dead silence ensued among the spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, M. de Wardes," said D'Artagnan, whom this recital had impressed
      more and more, as his own recollection revived as Athos spoke, "you see
      that my crime did not cause the destruction of any one's soul, and that
      the soul in question may fairly be considered to have been altogether lost
      before my regret. It is, however, an act of conscience on my part. Now
      this matter is settled, therefore, it remains for me to ask, with the
      greatest humility, your forgiveness for this shameless action, as most
      certainly I should have asked it of your father, if he were still alive,
      and if I had met him after my return to France, subsequent to the death of
      King Charles I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is too much, M. d'Artagnan," exclaimed many voices, with animation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, gentlemen," said the captain. "And now, M. de Wardes, I hope all is
      finished between us, and that you will have no further occasion to speak
      ill of me again. Do you consider it completely settled?"
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes bowed, and muttered to himself inarticulately.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust also," said D'Artagnan, approaching the young man closely, "that
      you will no longer speak ill of any one, as it seems you have the
      unfortunate habit of doing; for a man so puritanically conscientious as
      you are, who can reproach an old soldier for a youthful freak
      five-and-thirty years after it happened, will allow me to ask whether you,
      who advocate such excessive purity of conscience, will undertake on your
      side to do nothing contrary either to conscience or the principle of
      honor. And now, listen attentively to what I am going to say, M. de
      Wardes, in conclusion. Take care that no tale, with which your name may be
      associated, reaches my ear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," said De Wardes, "it is useless threatening to no purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not yet finished, M. de Wardes, and you must listen to me still
      further." The circle of listeners, full of eager curiosity, drew closer.
      "You spoke just now of the honor of a woman, and of the honor of your
      father. We were glad to hear you speak in that manner; for it is pleasing
      to think that such a sentiment of delicacy and rectitude, and which did
      not exist, it seems, in <i>our</i> minds, lives in our children; and it is
      delightful, too, to see a young man, at an age when men from habit become
      the destroyers of the honor of women, respect and defend it."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes bit his lip and clenched his hands, evidently much disturbed to
      learn how this discourse, the commencement of which was announced in so
      threatening a manner, would terminate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did it happen, then, that you allowed yourself to say to M. de
      Bragelonne that he did not know who his mother was?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul's eyes flashed, as, darting forward, he exclaimed,&mdash;"Chevalier,
      this is a personal affair of my own!" At which exclamation, a smile, full
      of malice, passed across De Wardes's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      D'Artagnan put Raoul aside, saying,&mdash;"Do not interrupt me, young
      man." And looking at De Wardes in an authoritative manner, he continued:&mdash;"I
      am now dealing with a matter which cannot be settled by means of the
      sword. I discuss it before men of honor, all of whom have more than once
      had their swords in their hands in affairs of honor. I selected them
      expressly. These gentlemen well know that every secret for which men fight
      ceases to be a secret. I again put my question to M. de Wardes. What was
      the subject of conversation when you offended this young man, in offending
      his father and mother at the same time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems to me," returned De Wardes, "that liberty of speech is allowed,
      when it is supported by every means which a man of courage has at his
      disposal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me what the means are by which a man of courage can sustain a
      slanderous expression."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sword."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You fail, not only in logic, in your argument, but in religion and honor.
      You expose the lives of many others, without referring to your own, which
      seems to be full of hazard. Besides, fashions pass away, monsieur, and the
      fashion of duelling has passed away, without referring in any way to the
      edicts of his majesty which forbid it. Therefore, in order to be
      consistent with your own chivalrous notions, you will at once apologize to
      M. de Bragelonne; you will tell him how much you regret having spoken so
      lightly, and that the nobility and purity of his race are inscribed, not
      in his heart alone, but still more in every action of his life. You will
      do and say this, M. de Wardes, as I, an old officer, did and said just now
      to your boy's moustache."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if I refuse?" inquired De Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case the result will be&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That which you think you will prevent," said De Wardes, laughing; "the
      result will be that your conciliatory address will end in a violation of
      the king's prohibition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so," said the captain, "you are quite mistaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will be the result, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The result will be that I shall go to the king, with whom I am on
      tolerably good terms, to whom I have been happy enough to render certain
      services, dating from a period when you were not born, and who, at my
      request, has just sent me an order in blank for M. Baisemeaux de
      Montlezun, governor of the Bastile; and I shall say to the king: 'Sire, a
      man has in a most cowardly way insulted M. de Bragelonne by insulting his
      mother; I have written this man's name upon the <i>lettre de cachet</i>
      which your majesty has been kind enough to give me, so that M. de Wardes
      is in the Bastile for three years." And D'Artagnan, drawing the order
      signed by the king from his pocket, held it towards De Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remarking that the young man was not quite convinced, and received the
      warning as an idle threat, he shrugged his shoulders and walked leisurely
      towards the table, upon which lay a writing-case and a pen, the length of
      which would have terrified the topographical Porthos. De Wardes then saw
      that nothing could well be more seriously intended than the threat in
      question, for the Bastile, even at that period, was already held in dread.
      He advanced a step towards Raoul, and, in an almost unintelligible voice,
      said,&mdash;"I offer my apologies in the terms which M. d'Artagnan just
      now dictated, and which I am forced to make to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One moment, monsieur," said the musketeer, with the greatest
      tranquillity, "you mistake the terms of the apology. I did not say, 'and
      which I am forced to make'; I said, 'and which my conscience induces me to
      make.' This latter expression, believe me, is better than the former; and
      it will be far preferable, since it will be the most truthful expression
      of your own sentiments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I subscribe to it," said De Wardes; "but submit, gentlemen, that a thrust
      of the sword through the body, as was the custom formerly, was far better
      than tyranny like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, monsieur," replied Buckingham; "for the sword-thrust, when received,
      was no indication that a particular person was right or wrong; it only
      showed that he was more or less skillful in the use of the weapon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur!" exclaimed De Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, now," interrupted D'Artagnan, "you are going to say something very
      rude, and I am rendering a service by stopping you in time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that all, monsieur?" inquired De Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely everything," replied D'Artagnan; "and these gentlemen, as well
      as myself, are quite satisfied with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe me, monsieur, that your reconciliations are not successful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, as we are now about to separate, I would wager that M. de
      Bragelonne and myself are greater enemies than ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are deceived, monsieur, as far as I am concerned," returned Raoul;
      "for I do not retain the slightest animosity in my heart against you."
    </p>
    <p>
      This last blow overwhelmed De Wardes. He cast his eyes around him like a
      man bewildered. D'Artagnan saluted most courteously the gentlemen who had
      been present at the explanation; and every one, on leaving the room, shook
      hands with him; but not one hand was held out towards De Wardes. "Oh!"
      exclaimed the young man, "can I not find some one on whom to wreak my
      vengeance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can, monsieur, for I am here," whispered a voice full of menace in
      his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes turned round, and saw the Duke of Buckingham, who, having
      probably remained behind with that intention, had just approached him.
      "You, monsieur?" exclaimed De Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I! I am no subject of the king of France; I am not going to remain
      on the territory, since I am about setting off for England. I have
      accumulated in my heart such a mass of despair and rage, that I, too, like
      yourself, need to revenge myself upon some one. I approve M. d'Artagnan's
      principles profoundly, but I am not bound to apply them to you. I am an
      Englishman, and, in my turn, I propose to you what you proposed to others
      to no purpose. Since you, therefore, are so terribly incensed, take me as
      a remedy. In thirty-four hours' time I shall be at Calais. Come with me;
      the journey will appear shorter if together, than if alone. We will fight,
      when we get there, upon the sands which are covered by the rising tide,
      and which form part of the French territory during six hours of the day,
      but belong to the territory of Heaven during the other six."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I accept willingly," said De Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I assure you," said the duke, "that if you kill me, you will be rendering
      me an infinite service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do my utmost to make myself agreeable to you, duke," said De
      Wardes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is agreed, then, that I carry you off with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be at your commands. I needed some real danger and some mortal
      risk to run, to tranquilize me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, I think you have met with what you are looking for.
      Farewell, M. de Wardes; to-morrow morning, my valet will tell you the
      exact hour of our departure; we can travel together like two excellent
      friends. I generally travel as fast as I can. Adieu."
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham saluted De Wardes, and returned towards the king's apartments;
      De Wardes, irritated beyond measure, left the Palais Royal, and hurried
      through the streets homeward to the house where he lodged.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXI. Baisemeaux de Montlezun.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After the austere lesson administered to De Wardes, Athos and D'Artagnan
      together descended the staircase which led to the courtyard of the Palais
      Royal. "You perceive," said Athos to D'Artagnan, "that Raoul cannot,
      sooner or later, avoid a duel with De Wardes, for De Wardes is as brave as
      he is vicious and wicked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know such fellows well," replied D'Artagnan; "I had an affair with the
      father. I assure you that, although at that time I had good muscles and a
      sort of brute courage&mdash;I assure you that the father did me some
      mischief. But you should have seen how I fought it out with him. Ah,
      Athos, such encounters never take place in these times! I had a hand which
      could never remain at rest, a hand like quicksilver,&mdash;you knew its
      quality, for you have seen me at work. My sword was no longer than a piece
      of steel; it was a serpent that assumed every form and every length,
      seeking where it might thrust its head; in other words, where it might fix
      its bite. I advanced half a dozen paces, then three, and then, body to
      body, I pressed my antagonist closely, then I darted back again ten paces.
      No human power could resist that ferocious ardor. Well, De Wardes the
      father, with the bravery of his race, with his dogged courage, occupied a
      good deal of my time; and my fingers, at the end of the engagement, were,
      I well remember, tired enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, then, as I said," resumed Athos, "the son will always be looking
      out for Raoul, and will end by meeting him; and Raoul can easily be found
      when he is sought for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Agreed; but Raoul calculates well; he bears no grudge against De Wardes,&mdash;he
      has said so; he will wait until he is provoked, and in that case his
      position is a good one. The king will not be able to get out of temper
      about the matter; besides we shall know how to pacify his majesty. But why
      so full of these fears and anxieties? You don't easily get alarmed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you what makes me anxious; Raoul is to see the king
      to-morrow, when his majesty will inform him of his wishes respecting a
      certain marriage. Raoul, loving as he does, will get out of temper, and
      once in an angry mood, if he were to meet De Wardes, the shell would
      explode."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will prevent the explosion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I," said Athos, "for I must return to Blois. All this gilded elegance
      of the court, all these intrigues, sicken me. I am no longer a young man
      who can make terms with the meanness of the day. I have read in the Great
      Book many things too beautiful and too comprehensive to longer take any
      interest in the trifling phrases which these men whisper among themselves
      when they wish to deceive others. In one word, I am weary of Paris
      wherever and whenever you are not with me; and as I cannot have you with
      me always, I wish to return to Blois."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How wrong you are, Athos; how you gainsay your origin and the destiny of
      your noble nature. Men of your stamp are created to continue, to the very
      last moment, in full possession of their great faculties. Look at my
      sword, a Spanish blade, the one I wore at La Rochelle; it served me for
      thirty years without fail; one day in the winter it fell upon the marble
      floor on the Louvre and was broken. I had a hunting-knife made of it which
      will last a hundred years yet. You, Athos, with your loyalty, your
      frankness, your cool courage, and your sound information, are the very man
      kings need to warn and direct them. Remain here; Monsieur Fouquet will not
      last as long as my Spanish blade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible," said Athos, smiling, "that my friend, D'Artagnan, who,
      after having raised me to the skies, making me an object of worship, casts
      me down from the top of Olympus, and hurls me to the ground? I have more
      exalted ambition, D'Artagnan. To be a minister&mdash;to be a slave,&mdash;never!
      Am I not still greater? I am nothing. I remember having heard you
      occasionally call me 'the great Athos'; I defy you, therefore, if I were
      minister, to continue to bestow that title upon me. No, no; I do not yield
      myself in this manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will not speak of it any more, then; renounce everything, even the
      brotherly feeling which unites us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is almost cruel what you say."
    </p>
    <p>
      D'Artagnan pressed Athos's hand warmly. "No, no; renounce everything
      without fear. Raoul can get on without you. I am at Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case I shall return to Blois. We will take leave of each other
      to-night; to-morrow at daybreak I shall be on my horse again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot return to your hotel alone; why did you not bring Grimaud with
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Grimaud takes his rest now; he goes to bed early, for my poor old servant
      gets easily fatigued. He came from Blois with me, and I compelled him to
      remain within doors; for if, in retracing the forty leagues which separate
      us from Blois, he needed to draw breath even, he would die without a
      murmur. But I don't want to lose Grimaud."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have one of my musketeers to carry a torch for you. <i>Hola!</i>
      some one there," called out D'Artagnan, leaning over the gilded
      balustrade. The heads of seven or eight musketeers appeared. "I wish some
      gentleman, who is so disposed, to escort the Comte de la Fere," cried
      D'Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you for your readiness, gentlemen," said Athos; "I regret to have
      occasion to trouble you in this manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would willingly escort the Comte de la Fere," said some one, "if I had
      not to speak to Monsieur d'Artagnan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is that?" said D'Artagnan, looking into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, Monsieur d'Artagnan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven forgive me, if that is not Monsieur Baisemeaux's voice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing in the courtyard, my dear Baisemeaux?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am waiting your orders, my dear Monsieur d'Artagnan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wretch that I am," thought D'Artagnan; "true, you have been told, I
      suppose, that some one was to be arrested, and have come yourself, instead
      of sending an officer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came because I had occasion to speak to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did not send to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I waited until you were disengaged," said Monsieur Baisemeaux, timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I leave you, D'Artagnan," said Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not before I have present Monsieur Baisemeaux de Montlezun, the governor
      of the Bastile."
    </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux and Athos saluted each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely you must know each other," said D'Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have an indistinct recollection of Monsieur Baisemeaux," said Athos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You remember, my dear, Baisemeaux, the king's guardsman with whom we used
      formerly to have such delightful meetings in the cardinal's time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly," said Athos, taking leave of him with affability.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur le Comte de la Fere, whose <i>nom de guerre</i> was Athos,"
      whispered D'Artagnan to Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, a brave man, one of the celebrated four."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely so. But, my dear Baisemeaux, shall we talk now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place, as for the orders&mdash;there are none. The king does
      not intend to arrest the person in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the worse," said Baisemeaux with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by so much the worse?" exclaimed D'Artagnan, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt of it," returned the governor, "my prisoners are my income."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, I did not see it in that light."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so there are no orders," repeated Baisemeaux with a sigh. "What an
      admirable situation yours is, captain," he continued, after a pause;
      "captain-lieutenant of the musketeers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it is good enough; but I don't see why you should envy me; you,
      governor of the Bastile, the first castle in France."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am well aware of that," said Baisemeaux, in a sorrowful tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say that like a man confessing his sins. I would willingly exchange
      my profits for yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't speak of profits to me, if you wish to save me the bitterest
      anguish of mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you look first on one side and then on the other, as if you were
      afraid of being arrested yourself, you whose business it is to arrest
      others?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was looking to see whether any one could see or listen to us; it would
      be safer to confer more in private, if you would grant me such a favor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Baisemeaux, you seem to forget we are acquaintances of five and thirty
      years' standing. Don't assume such sanctified airs; make yourself quite
      comfortable; I don't eat governors of the Bastile raw."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven be praised!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come into the courtyard with me; it's a beautiful moonlit night; we will
      walk up and down, arm in arm, under the trees, while you tell me your
      pitiful tale." He drew the doleful governor into the courtyard, took him
      by the arm as he had said, and, in his rough, good-humored way, cried:
      "Out with it, rattle away, Baisemeaux; what have you got to say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a long story."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You prefer your own lamentations, then; my opinion is, it will be longer
      than ever. I'll wager you are making fifty thousand francs out of your
      pigeons in the Bastile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would to heaven that were the case, M. d'Artagnan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You surprise me, Baisemeaux; just look at you, acting the anchorite. I
      should like to show you your face in a glass, and you would see how plump
      and florid-looking you are, as fat and round as a cheese, with eyes like
      lighted coals; and if it were not for that ugly wrinkle you try to
      cultivate on your forehead, you would hardly look fifty years old, and you
      are sixty, if I am not mistaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All quite true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I knew it was true, as true as the fifty thousand francs profit
      you make;" at which remark Baisemeaux stamped on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," said D'Artagnan, "I will add up your accounts for you: you
      were captain of M. Mazarin's guards; and twelve thousand francs a year
      would in twelve years amount to one hundred and forty thousand francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Twelve thousand francs! Are you mad?" cried Baisemeaux; "the old miser
      gave me no more than six thousand, and the expenses of the post amounted
      to six thousand five hundred francs. M. Colbert, who deducted the other
      six thousand francs, condescended to allow me to take fifty thousand
      francs as a gratification; so that, if it were not for my little estate at
      Montlezun, which brings me in twelve thousand francs a year, I could not
      have met my engagements."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, how about the fifty thousand francs from the Bastile? There,
      I trust, you are boarded and lodged, and get your six thousand francs
      salary besides."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admitted!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whether the year be good or bad, there are fifty prisoners, who, on the
      average, bring you in a thousand francs a year each."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't deny it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there is at once an income of fifty thousand francs; you have held
      the post three years, and must have received in that time one hundred and
      fifty thousand francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You forget one circumstance, dear M. d'Artagnan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That while you received your appointment as captain from the king
      himself, I received mine as governor from Messieurs Tremblay and
      Louviere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite right, and Tremblay was not a man to let you have the post for
      nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor Louviere either: the result was, that I gave seventy-five thousand
      francs to Tremblay as his share."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very agreeable that! and to Louviere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Money down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: that would have been impossible. The king did not wish, or rather M.
      Mazarin did not wish, to have the appearance of removing those two
      gentlemen, who had sprung from the barricades; he permitted them,
      therefore, to make certain extravagant conditions for their retirement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What were those conditions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tremble... three years' income for the good-will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The deuce! so that the one hundred and fifty thousand francs have passed
      into their hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And beyond that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sum of one hundred and fifty thousand francs, or fifteen thousand
      pistoles, whichever you please, in three payments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exorbitant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but that is not all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What besides?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In default of the fulfillment by me of any one of those conditions, those
      gentlemen enter upon their functions again. The king has been induced to
      sign that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is monstrous, incredible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such is the fact, however."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do indeed pity you, Baisemeaux. But why, in the name of fortune, did M.
      Mazarin grant you this pretended favor? It would have been far better to
      have refused you altogether."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, but he was strongly persuaded to do so by my protector."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of your own friends, indeed; M. d'Herblay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. d'Herblay! Aramis!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so; he has been very kind towards me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kind! to make you enter into such a bargain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen! I wished to leave the cardinal's service. M. d'Herblay spoke on
      my behalf to Louviere and Tremblay&mdash;they objected; I wished to have
      the appointment very much, for I knew what it could be made to produce; in
      my distress I confided in M. d'Herblay, and he offered to become my surety
      for the different payments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You astound me! Aramis became your surety?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like a man of honor; he procured the signature; Tremblay and Louviere
      resigned their appointments; I have paid every year twenty-five thousand
      francs to these two gentlemen; on the thirty-first of May, every year, M.
      d'Herblay himself comes to the Bastile, and brings me five thousand
      pistoles to distribute between my crocodiles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You owe Aramis one hundred and fifty thousand francs, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the very thing which is the cause of my despair, for I only owe
      him one hundred thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't quite understand you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He came and settled with the vampires only two years. To-day, however, is
      the thirty-first of May, and he has not been yet, and to-morrow, at
      midday, the payment falls due; if, therefore, I don't pay to-morrow, those
      gentlemen can, by the terms of the contract, break off the bargain; I
      shall be stripped of everything; I shall have worked for three years, and
      given two hundred and fifty thousand francs for nothing, absolutely for
      nothing at all, dear M. d'Artagnan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is very strange," murmured D'Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can now imagine that I may well have wrinkles on my forehead, can you
      not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you can imagine, too, that notwithstanding I may be as round as a
      cheese, with a complexion like an apple, and my eyes like coals on fire, I
      may almost be afraid that I shall not have a cheese or an apple left me to
      eat, and that my eyes will be left me only to weep with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is really a very grievous affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come to you, M. d'Artagnan, for you are the only man who can get
      me out of my trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are acquainted with the Abbe d'Herblay, and you know that he is a
      somewhat mysterious gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you can, perhaps, give me the address of his presbytery, for I have
      been to Noisy-le-Sec, and he is no longer there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think not, indeed. He is Bishop of Vannes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! Vannes in Bretagne?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man began to tear his hair, saying, "How can I get to Vannes
      from here by midday to-morrow? I am a lost man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your despair quite distresses me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vannes, Vannes!" cried Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But listen; a bishop is not always a resident. M. d'Herblay may not
      possibly be so far away as you fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray tell me his address."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really don't know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case I am lost. I will go and throw myself at the king's feet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Baisemeaux, I can hardly believe what you tell me; besides, since
      the Bastile is capable of producing fifty thousand francs a year, why have
      you not tried to screw one hundred thousand out of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I am an honest man, M. d'Artagnan, and because my prisoners are
      fed like ambassadors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you're in a fair way to get out of your difficulties; give yourself
      a good attack of indigestion with your excellent living, and put yourself
      out of the way between this and midday to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you be hard-hearted enough to laugh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, you really afflict me. Come, Baisemeaux, if you can pledge me your
      word of honor, do so, that you will not open your lips to any one about
      what I am going to say to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wish to put your hands on Aramis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At any cost!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, go and see where M. Fouquet is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what connection can there be&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How stupid you are! Don't you know that Vannes is in the diocese of
      Belle-Isle, or Belle-Isle in the diocese of Vannes? Belle-Isle belongs to
      M. Fouquet, and M. Fouquet nominated M. d'Herblay to that bishopric!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see, I see; you restore me to life again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the better. Go and tell M. Fouquet very simply that you wish to
      speak to M. d'Herblay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, of course," exclaimed Baisemeaux, delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said D'Artagnan, checking him by a severe look, "your word of
      honor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give you my sacred word of honor," replied the little man, about to set
      off running.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To M. Fouquet's house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is useless doing that; M. Fouquet is playing at cards with the king.
      All you can do is to pay M. Fouquet a visit early to-morrow morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do so. Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good luck attend you," said D'Artagnan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a strange affair," murmured D'Artagnan, as he slowly ascended the
      staircase after he had left Baisemeaux. "What possible interest can Aramis
      have in obliging Baisemeaux in this manner? Well, I suppose we shall learn
      some day or another."

      Chapter XXII. The King's Card-Table.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Fouquet was present, as D'Artagnan had said, at the king's card-table. It
      seemed as if Buckingham's departure had shed a balm on the lacerated
      hearts of the previous evening. Monsieur, radiant with delight, made a
      thousand affectionate signs to his mother. The Count de Guiche could not
      separate himself from Buckingham, and while playing, conversed with him
      upon the circumstance of his projected voyage. Buckingham, thoughtful, and
      kind in his manner, like a man who has adopted a resolution, listened to
      the count, and from time to time cast a look full of regret and hopeless
      affection at Madame. The princess, in the midst of her elation of spirits,
      divided her attention between the king, who was playing with her,
      Monsieur, who quietly joked her about her enormous winnings, and De
      Guiche, who exhibited an extravagant delight. Of Buckingham she took but
      little notice; for her, this fugitive, this exile, was now simply a
      remembrance, no longer a man. Light hearts are thus constituted; while
      they themselves continue untouched, they roughly break off with every one
      who may possibly interfere with their little calculations of self comfort.
      Madame had received Buckingham's smiles and attentions and sighs while he
      was present; but what was the good of sighing, smiling, and kneeling at a
      distance? Can one tell in what direction the winds in the Channel, which
      toss mighty vessels to and fro, carry such sighs as these? The duke could
      not fail to mark this change, and his heart was cruelly hurt. Of a
      sensitive character, proud and susceptible of deep attachment, he cursed
      the day on which such a passion had entered his heart. The looks he cast,
      from time to time at Madame, became colder by degrees at the chilling
      complexion of his thoughts. He could hardly yet despair, but he was strong
      enough to impose silence upon the tumultuous outcries of his heart. In
      exact proportion, however, as Madame suspected this change of feeling, she
      redoubled her activity to regain the ray of light she was about to lose;
      her timid and indecisive mind was displayed in brilliant flashes of wit
      and humor. At any cost she felt that she must be remarked above everything
      and every one, even above the king himself. And she was so, for the
      queens, notwithstanding their dignity, and the king, despite the respect
      which etiquette required, were all eclipsed by her. The queens, stately
      and ceremonious, were softened and could not restrain their laughter.
      Madame Henriette, the queen-mother, was dazzled by the brilliancy which
      cast distinction upon her family, thanks to the wit of the grand-daughter
      of Henry IV. The king, jealous, as a young man and as a monarch, of the
      superiority of those who surrounded him, could not resist admitting
      himself vanquished by a petulance so thoroughly French in its nature,
      whose energy more than ever increased by English humor. Like a child, he
      was captivated by her radiant beauty, which her wit made still more
      dazzling. Madame's eyes flashed like lightning. Wit and humor escaped from
      her scarlet lips like persuasion from the lips of Nestor of old. The whole
      court, subdued by her enchanting grace, noticed for the first time that
      laughter could be indulged in before the greatest monarch in the world,
      like people who merited their appellation of the wittiest and most
      polished people in Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame, from that evening, achieved and enjoyed a success capable of
      bewildering all not born to those altitudes termed thrones; which, in
      spite of their elevation, are sheltered from such giddiness. From that
      very moment Louis XIV. acknowledged Madame as a person to be recognized.
      Buckingham regarded her as a coquette deserving the cruelest tortures, and
      De Guiche looked upon her as a divinity; the courtiers as a star whose
      light might some day become the focus of all favor and power. And yet
      Louis XIV., a few years previously, had not even condescended to offer his
      hand to that "ugly girl" for a ballet; and Buckingham had worshipped this
      coquette "on both knees." De Guiche had once looked upon this divinity as
      a mere woman; and the courtiers had not dared to extol this star in her
      upward progress, fearful to disgust the monarch whom such a dull star had
      formerly displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us see what was taking place during this memorable evening at the
      king's card-table. The young queen, although Spanish by birth, and the
      niece of Anne of Austria, loved the king, and could not conceal her
      affection. Anne of Austria, a keen observer, like all women, and
      imperious, like every queen, was sensible of Madame's power, and
      acquiesced in it immediately, a circumstance which induced the young queen
      to raise the siege and retire to her apartments. The king hardly paid any
      attention to her departure, notwithstanding the pretended symptoms of
      indisposition by which it was accompanied. Encouraged by the rules of
      etiquette, which he had begun to introduce at the court as an element of
      every relation of life, Louis XIV. did not disturb himself; he offered his
      hand to Madame without looking at Monsieur his brother, and led the young
      princess to the door of her apartments. It was remarked, that at the
      threshold of the door, his majesty, freed from every restraint, or not
      equal to the situation, sighed very deeply. The ladies present&mdash;nothing
      escapes a woman's glance&mdash;Mademoiselle Montalais, for instance&mdash;did
      not fail to say to each other, "the king sighed," and "Madame sighed too."
      This had been indeed the case. Madame had sighed very noiselessly, but
      with an accompaniment very far more dangerous for the king's repose.
      Madame had sighed, first closing her beautiful black eyes, next opening
      them, and then, laden, as they were, with an indescribable mournfulness of
      expression, she had raised them towards the king, whose face at that
      moment visibly heightened in color. The consequence of these blushes, of
      those interchanged sighs, and of this royal agitation, was, that Montalais
      had committed an indiscretion which had certainly affected her companion,
      for Mademoiselle de la Valliere, less clear sighted, perhaps, turned pale
      when the king blushed; and her attendance being required upon Madame, she
      tremblingly followed the princess without thinking of taking the gloves,
      which court etiquette required her to do. True it is that the young
      country girl might allege as her excuse the agitation into which the king
      seemed to be thrown, for Mademoiselle de la Valliere, busily engaged in
      closing the door, had involuntarily fixed her eyes upon the king, who, as
      he retired backwards, had his face towards it. The king returned to the
      room where the card-tables were set out. He wished to speak to the
      different persons there, but it was easy to see that his mind was absent.
      He jumbled different accounts together, which was taken advantage of by
      some of the noblemen who had retained those habits since the time of
      Monsieur Mazarin&mdash;who had a poor memory, but was a good calculator.
      In this way, Monsieur Manicamp, with a thoughtless and absent air&mdash;for
      M. Manicamp was the honestest man in the world, appropriated twenty
      thousand francs, which were littering the table, and which did not seem to
      belong to any person in particular. In the same way, Monsieur de Wardes,
      whose head was doubtless a little bewildered by the occurrences of the
      evening, somehow forgot to leave behind him the sixty double louis which
      he had won for the Duke of Buckingham, and which the duke, incapable, like
      his father, of soiling his hands with coin of any sort, had left lying on
      the table before him. The king only recovered his attention in some degree
      at the moment that Monsieur Colbert, who had been narrowly observant for
      some minutes, approached, and, doubtless, with great respect, yet with
      much perseverance, whispered a counsel of some sort into the still
      tingling ears of the king. The king, at the suggestion, listened with
      renewed attention and immediately looking around him, said, "Is Monsieur
      Fouquet no longer here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire, I am here," replied the superintendent, till then engaged with
      Buckingham, and approached the king, who advanced a step towards him with
      a smiling yet negligent air. "Forgive me," said Louis, "if I interrupt
      your conversation; but I claim your attention wherever I may require your
      services."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am always at the king's service," replied Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your cash-box, too," said the king, laughing with a false smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My cash-box more than anything else," said Fouquet, coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is, I wish to give a <i>fete</i> at Fontainebleau&mdash;to keep
      open house for fifteen days, and I shall require&mdash;" and he stopped,
      glancing at Colbert. Fouquet waited without showing discomposure; and the
      king resumed, answering Colbert's icy smile, "four million francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Four million," repeated Fouquet, bowing profoundly. And his nails, buried
      in his bosom, were thrust into his flesh, but the tranquil expression of
      his face remained unaltered. "When will they be required, sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take your time,&mdash;I mean&mdash;no, no; as soon as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A certain time will be necessary, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Time!" exclaimed Colbert, triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The time, monsieur," said the superintendent, with the haughtiest
      disdain, "simply to <i>count the money</i>; a million can only be drawn
      and weighed in a day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Four days, then," said Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My clerks," replied Fouquet, addressing himself to the king, "will
      perform wonders on his majesty's service, and the sum shall be ready in
      three days."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was for Colbert now to turn pale. Louis looked at him astonished.
      Fouquet withdrew without any parade or weakness, smiling at his numerous
      friends, in whose countenances alone he read the sincerity of their
      friendship&mdash;an interest partaking of compassion. Fouquet, however,
      should not be judged by his smile, for, in reality, he felt as if he had
      been stricken by death. Drops of blood beneath his coat stained the fine
      linen that clothed his chest. His dress concealed the blood, and his smile
      the rage which devoured him. His domestics perceived, by the manner in
      which he approached his carriage, that their master was not in the best of
      humors: the result of their discernment was, that his orders were executed
      with that exactitude of maneuver which is found on board a man-of-war,
      commanded during a storm by an ill-tempered captain. The carriage,
      therefore, did not simply roll along&mdash;it flew. Fouquet had hardly
      time to recover himself during the drive; on his arrival he went at once
      to Aramis, who had not yet retired for the night. As for Porthos, he had
      supped very agreeably off a roast leg of mutton, two pheasants, and a
      perfect heap of cray-fish; he then directed his body to be anointed with
      perfumed oils, in the manner of the wrestlers of old; and when this
      anointment was completed, he had himself wrapped in flannels and placed in
      a warm bed. Aramis, as we have already said, had not retired. Seated at
      his ease in a velvet dressing-gown, he wrote letter after letter in that
      fine and hurried handwriting, a page of which contained a quarter of a
      volume. The door was thrown hurriedly open, and the superintendent
      appeared, pale, agitated, anxious. Aramis looked up: "Good-evening," said
      he; and his searching look detected his host's sadness and disordered
      state of mind. "Was your play as good as his majesty's?" asked Aramis, by
      way of beginning the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet threw himself upon a couch, and then pointed to the door to the
      servant who had followed him; when the servant had left he said,
      "Excellent."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis, who had followed every movement with his eyes, noticed that he
      stretched himself upon the cushions with a sort of feverish impatience.
      "You have lost as usual?" inquired Aramis, his pen still in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even more than usual," replied Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know how to support losses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, Monsieur Fouquet a bad player!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is play and play, Monsieur d'Herblay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much have you lost?" inquired Aramis, with a slight uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet collected himself a moment, and then, without the slightest
      emotion, said, "The evening has cost me four millions," and a bitter laugh
      drowned the last vibration of these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis, who did not expect such an amount, dropped his pen. "Four
      millions," he said; "you have lost four millions,&mdash;impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Colbert held my cards for me," replied the superintendent, with
      a similar bitter laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, now I understand; so, so, a new application for funds?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and from the king's own lips. It was impossible to ruin a man with a
      more charming smile. What do you think of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is clear that your destruction is the object in view."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is your opinion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still. Besides, there is nothing in it which should astonish you, for we
      have foreseen it all along."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but I did not expect four millions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt the amount is serious, but, after all, four millions are not
      quite the death of a man, especially when the man in question is Monsieur
      Fouquet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear D'Herblay, if you knew the contents of my coffers, you would be
      less easy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you promised?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What could I <i>do?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very day I refuse, Colbert will procure the money; whence I know not,
      but he <i>will</i> procure it: and I shall be lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no doubt of that. In how many days did you promise the four
      millions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In three days. The king seemed exceedingly pressed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>In three days?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I think," resumed Fouquet, "that just now as I passed along the
      streets, the people cried out, 'There is the rich Monsieur Fouquet,' it is
      enough to turn my brain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay, monsieur, the matter is not worth so much trouble," said Aramis,
      calmly, sprinkling some sand over the letter he had just written.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suggest a remedy, then, for this evil without a remedy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is only one remedy for you,&mdash;pay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is very uncertain whether I have the money. Everything must be
      exhausted; Belle-Isle is paid for; the pension has been paid; and money,
      since the investigation of the accounts of those who farm the revenue, is
      scarce. Besides, admitting that I pay this time, how can I do so on
      another occasion? When kings have tasted money, they are like tigers who
      have tasted flesh, they devour everything. The day will arrive&mdash;<i>must</i>
      arrive&mdash;when I shall have to say, 'Impossible, sire,' and on that
      very day I am a lost man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis raised his shoulders slightly, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man in your position, my lord, is only lost when he wishes to be so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man, whatever his position may be, cannot hope to struggle against a
      king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense; when I was young I wrestled successfully with the Cardinal
      Richelieu, who was king of France,&mdash;nay more&mdash;cardinal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are my armies, my troops, my treasures? I have not even
      Belle-Isle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah! necessity is the mother of invention, and when you think all is
      lost, something will be discovered which will retrieve everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who will discover this wonderful something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I! I resign my office of inventor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then <i>I</i> will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so. But set to work without delay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! we have time enough!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You kill me, D'Herblay, with your calmness," said the superintendent,
      passing his handkerchief over his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not remember that I one day told you not to make yourself uneasy,
      if you possessed courage? <i>Have</i> you any?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then don't make yourself uneasy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is decided then, that, at the last moment, you will come to my
      assistance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will only be the repayment of a debt I owe you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the vocation of financiers to anticipate the wants of men such as
      yourself, D'Herblay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If obligingness is the vocation of financiers, charity is the virtue of
      the clergy. Only, on this occasion, do you act, monsieur. You are not yet
      sufficiently reduced, and at the last moment we will see what is to be
      done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall see, then, in a very short time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. However, permit me to tell you that, personally, I regret
      exceedingly that you are at present so short of money, because I myself
      was about to ask you for some."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For myself, or some of my people, for mine or for ours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be easy on that score; a roundish sum, it is true, but not too
      exorbitant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me the amount."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fifty thousand francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! a mere nothing. Of course one has always fifty thousand francs. Why
      the deuce cannot that knave Colbert be as easily satisfied as you are&mdash;and
      I should give myself far less trouble than I do. When do you need this
      sum?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow morning; but you wish to know its destination?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay, chevalier, I need no explanation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow is the first of June."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of our bonds becomes due."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not know we had any bonds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, to-morrow we pay our last third instalment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What third?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the one hundred and fifty thousand francs to Baisemeaux."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Baisemeaux? Who is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The governor of the Bastile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I remember. On what grounds am I to pay one hundred and fifty
      thousand francs for that man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On account of the appointment which he, or rather we, purchased from
      Louviere and Tremblay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a very vague recollection of the matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is likely enough, for you have so many affairs to attend to.
      However, I do not believe you have any affair in the world of greater
      importance than this one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, then, why we purchased this appointment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, in order to render him a service in the first place, and afterwards
      ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ourselves? You are joking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur, the time may come when the governor of the Bastile may prove
      a very excellent acquaintance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not the good fortune to understand you, D'Herblay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur, we had our own poets, our own engineer, our own architect,
      our own musicians, our own printer, and our own painters; we needed our
      own governor of the Bastile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us not deceive ourselves, monseigneur; we are very much opposed to
      paying the Bastile a visit," added the prelate, displaying, beneath his
      pale lips, teeth which were still the same beautiful teeth so much admired
      thirty years previously by Marie Michon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you think it is not too much to pay one hundred and fifty thousand
      francs for that? I thought you generally put out money at better interest
      than that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The day will come when you will admit your mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear D'Herblay, the very day on which a man enters the Bastile, he is
      no longer protected by his past."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he is, if the bonds are perfectly regular; besides, that good fellow
      Baisemeaux has not a courtier's heart. I am certain, my lord, that he will
      not remain ungrateful for that money, without taking into account, I
      repeat, that I retain the acknowledgements."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a strange affair! usury in a matter of benevolence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not mix yourself up with it, monseigneur; if there be usury, it is I
      who practice it, and both of us reap the advantage from it&mdash;that is
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some intrigue, D'Herblay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not deny it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Baisemeaux an accomplice in it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?&mdash;there are worse accomplices than he. May I depend, then,
      upon the five thousand pistoles to-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want them this evening?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be better, for I wish to start early; poor Baisemeaux will not
      be able to imagine what has be become of me, and must be upon thorns."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have the amount in an hour. Ah, D'Herblay, the interest of your
      one hundred and fifty thousand francs will never pay my four millions for
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not, monseigneur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-night, I have business to transact with my clerks before I retire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good night's rest, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "D'Herblay, you wish things that are impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I have my fifty thousand francs this evening?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go to sleep, then, in perfect safety&mdash;it is I who tell you to do
      so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding this assurance, and the tone in which it was given,
      Fouquet left the room shaking his head, and heaving a sigh.

      Chapter XXIII. M. Baisemeaux de Montlezun's Accounts.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The clock of St. Paul was striking seven as Aramis, on horseback, dressed
      as a simple citizen, that is to say, in colored suit, with no distinctive
      mark about him, except a kind of hunting-knife by his side, passed before
      the Rue du Petit-Musc, and stopped opposite the Rue des Tournelles, at the
      gate of the Bastile. Two sentinels were on duty at the gate; they made no
      difficulty about admitting Aramis, who entered without dismounting, and
      they pointed out the way he was to go by a long passage with buildings on
      both sides. This passage led to the drawbridge, or, in other words, to the
      real entrance. The drawbridge was down, and the duty of the day was about
      being entered upon. The sentinel at the outer guardhouse stopped Aramis's
      further progress, asking him, in a rough tone of voice, what had brought
      him there. Aramis explained, with his usual politeness, that a wish to
      speak to M. Baisemeaux de Montlezun had occasioned his visit. The first
      sentinel then summoned a second sentinel, stationed within an inner lodge,
      who showed his face at the grating, and inspected the new arrival most
      attentively. Aramis reiterated the expression of his wish to see the
      governor; whereupon the sentinel called to an officer of lower grade, who
      was walking about in a tolerably spacious courtyard and who, in turn, on
      being informed of his object, ran to seek one of the officers of the
      governor's staff. The latter, after having listened to Aramis's request,
      begged him to wait a moment, then went away a short distance, but returned
      to ask his name. "I cannot tell it you, monsieur," said Aramis; "I need
      only mention that I have matters of such importance to communicate to the
      governor, that I can only rely beforehand upon one thing, that M. de
      Baisemeaux will be delighted to see me; nay, more than that, when you have
      told him that it is the person whom he expected on the first of June, I am
      convinced he will hasten here himself." The officer could not possibly
      believe that a man of the governor's importance should put himself out for
      a person of so little importance as the citizen-looking visitor on
      horseback. "It happens most fortunately, monsieur," he said, "that the
      governor is just going out, and you can perceive his carriage with the
      horses already harnessed, in the courtyard yonder; there will be no
      occasion for him to come to meet you, as he will see you as he passes by."
      Aramis bowed to signify his assent; he did not wish to inspire others with
      too exalted an opinion of himself, and therefore waited patiently and in
      silence, leaning upon the saddle-bow of his horse. Ten minutes had hardly
      elapsed when the governor's carriage was observed to move. The governor
      appeared at the door, and got into the carriage, which immediately
      prepared to start. The same ceremony was observed for the governor himself
      as with a suspected stranger; the sentinel at the lodge advanced as the
      carriage was about to pass under the arch, and the governor opened the
      carriage-door, himself setting the example of obedience to orders; so
      that, in this way, the sentinel could convince himself that no one quitted
      the Bastile improperly. The carriage rolled along under the archway, but
      at the moment the iron-gate was opened, the officer approached the
      carriage, which had again been stopped, and said something to the
      governor, who immediately put his head out of the door-way, and perceived
      Aramis on horseback at the end of the drawbridge. He immediately uttered
      almost a shout of delight, and got out, or rather darted out of his
      carriage, running towards Aramis, whose hands he seized, making a thousand
      apologies. He almost embraced him. "What a difficult matter to enter the
      Bastile!" said Aramis. "Is it the same for those who are sent here against
      their wills, as for those who come of their own accord?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thousand pardons, my lord. How delighted I am to see your Grace!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! What are you thinking of, my dear M. Baisemeaux? What do you
      suppose would be thought of a bishop in my present costume?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray, excuse me, I had forgotten. Take this gentleman's horse to the
      stables," cried Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said Aramis; "I have five thousand pistoles in the saddle-bags."
    </p>
    <p>
      The governor's countenance became so radiant, that if the prisoners had
      seen him they would have imagined some prince of the royal blood had
      arrived. "Yes, you are right, the horse shall be taken to the government
      house. Will you get into the carriage, my dear M. d'Herblay? and it shall
      take us back to my house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get into a carriage to cross a courtyard! do you believe I am so great an
      invalid? No, no, we will go on foot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux then offered his arm as a support, but the prelate did not
      accept it. They arrived in this manner at the government house, Baisemeaux
      rubbing his hands and glancing at the horse from time to time, while
      Aramis was looking at the bleak bare walls. A tolerably handsome vestibule
      and a staircase of white stone led to the governor's apartments, who
      crossed the ante-chamber, the dining-room, where breakfast was being
      prepared, opened a small side door, and closeted himself with his guest in
      a large cabinet, the windows of which opened obliquely upon the courtyard
      and the stables. Baisemeaux installed the prelate with that all-inclusive
      politeness of which a good man, or a grateful man, alone possesses the
      secret. An arm-chair, a footstool, a small table beside him, on which to
      rest his hand, everything was prepared by the governor himself. With his
      own hands, too, he placed upon the table, with much solicitude, the bag
      containing the gold, which one of the soldiers had brought up with the
      most respectful devotion; and the soldier having left the room, Baisemeaux
      himself closed the door after him, drew aside one of the window-curtains,
      and looked steadfastly at Aramis to see if the prelate required anything
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my lord," he said, still standing up, "of all men of their word,
      you still continue to be the most punctual."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In matters of business, dear M. de Baisemeaux, exactitude is not a virtue
      only, it is a duty as well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, in matters of business, certainly; but what you have with me is not
      of that character; it is a service you are rendering me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, confess, dear M. de Baisemeaux, that, notwithstanding this
      exactitude, you have not been without a little uneasiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About your health, I certainly have," stammered out Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wished to come here yesterday, but I was not able, as I was too
      fatigued," continued Aramis. Baisemeaux anxiously slipped another cushion
      behind his guest's back. "But," continued Aramis, "I promised myself to
      come and pay you a visit to-day, early in the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are really very kind, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it was a good thing for me I was punctual, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you were going out." At which latter remark Baisemeaux colored and
      said, "It is true I was going out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I prevent you," said Aramis; whereupon the embarrassment of
      Baisemeaux became visibly greater. "I am putting you to inconvenience," he
      continued, fixing a keen glace upon the poor governor; "if I had known
      that, I should not have come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can your lordship imagine that you could ever inconvenience me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confess you were going in search of money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," stammered out Baisemeaux, "no! I assure you I was going to&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does the governor still intend to go to M. Fouquet?" suddenly called out
      the major from below. Baisemeaux ran to the window like a madman. "No,
      no," he exclaimed in a state of desperation, "who the deuce is speaking of
      M. Fouquet? are you drunk below there? why am I interrupted when I am
      engaged on business?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were going to M. Fouquet's," said Aramis, biting his lips, "to M.
      Fouquet, the abbe, or the superintendent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux almost made up his mind to tell an untruth, but he could not
      summon courage to do so. "To the superintendent," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true, then, that you were in want of money, since you were going to
      a person who gives it away!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I assure you, my lord&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were afraid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear lord, it was the uncertainty and ignorance in which I was as to
      where you were to be found."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would have found the money you require at M. Fouquet's, for he is a
      man whose hand is always open."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I swear that I should never have ventured to ask M. Fouquet for money. I
      only wished to ask him for your address."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To ask M. Fouquet for my address?" exclaimed Aramis, opening his eyes in
      real astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Baisemeaux, greatly disturbed by the glance which the prelate
      fixed upon him,&mdash;"at M. Fouquet's certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no harm in that, dear M. Baisemeaux, only I would ask, why ask
      my address of M. Fouquet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I might write to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand," said Aramis smiling, "but that is not what I meant; I do
      not ask you what you required my address for: I only ask why you should go
      to M. Fouquet for it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Baisemeaux, "as Belle-Isle is the property of M. Fouquet, and
      as Belle-Isle is in the diocese of Vannes, and as you are bishop of Vannes&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, my dear Baisemeaux, since you knew I was bishop of Vannes, you had
      no occasion to ask M. Fouquet for my address."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, monsieur," said Baisemeaux, completely at bay, "if I have acted
      indiscreetly, I beg your pardon most sincerely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense," observed Aramis calmly: "how can you possibly have acted
      indiscreetly?" And while he composed his face, and continued to smile
      cheerfully on the governor, he was considering how Baisemeaux, who was not
      aware of his address, knew, however, that Vannes was his residence. "I
      shall clear all this up," he said to himself; and then speaking aloud,
      added,&mdash;"Well, my dear governor shall we now arrange our little
      accounts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am at your orders, my lord; but tell me beforehand, my lord, whether
      you will do me the honor to breakfast with me as usual?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very willingly, indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's well," said Baisemeaux, as he struck the bell before him three
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does that mean?" inquired Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I have some one to breakfast with me, and that preparations are to
      be made accordingly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you rang thrice. Really, my dear governor, I begin to think you are
      acting ceremoniously with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed. Besides, the least I can do is to receive you in the best way
      I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because not even a prince could have done what you have done for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense! nonsense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, I assure you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us speak of other matters," said Aramis. "Or rather, tell me how your
      affairs here are getting on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not over well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The deuce!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Mazarin was not hard enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I see; you require a government full of suspicion&mdash;like that of
      the old cardinal, for instance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; matters went on better under him. The brother of his 'gray eminence'
      made his fortune here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe me, my dear governor," said Aramis, drawing closer to Baisemeaux,
      "a young king is well worth an old cardinal. Youth has its suspicions, its
      fits of anger, its prejudices, as old age has its hatreds, its
      precautions, and its fears. Have you paid your three years' profits to
      Louvidre and Tremblay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most certainly I have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that you have nothing more to give them than the fifty thousand francs
      I have brought with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you not saved anything, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, in giving the fifty thousand francs of my own to these
      gentlemen, I assure you that I gave them everything I gain. I told M.
      d'Artagnan so yesterday evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Aramis, whose eyes sparkled for a moment, but became
      immediately afterwards as unmoved as before; "so you have been to see my
      old friend D'Artagnan; how was he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonderfully well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did you say to him, M. de Baisemeaux?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told him," continued the governor, not perceiving his own
      thoughtlessness; "I told him that I fed my prisoners too well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How many have you?" inquired Aramis, in an indifferent tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sixty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that is a tolerably round number."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In former times, my lord, there were, during certain years, as many as
      two hundred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still a minimum of sixty is not to be grumbled at."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not; for, to anybody but myself, each prisoner would bring in two
      hundred and fifty pistoles; for instance, for a prince of the blood I have
      fifty francs a day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only you have no prince of the blood; at least, I suppose so," said
      Aramis, with a slight tremor in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, thank heaven!&mdash;I mean, no, unfortunately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by unfortunately?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because my appointment would be improved by it. So fifty francs per day
      for a prince of the blood, thirty-six for a marechal of France&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you have as many marechals of France, I suppose, as you have princes
      of the blood?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! no more. It is true lieutenant-generals and brigadiers pay
      twenty-six francs, and I have two of them. After that, come councilors of
      parliament, who bring me fifteen francs, and I have six of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not know," said Aramis, "that councilors were so productive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but from fifteen francs I sink at once to ten francs; namely, for an
      ordinary judge, and for an ecclesiastic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have seven, you say; an excellent affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, a bad one, and for this reason. How can I possibly treat these poor
      fellows, who are of some good, at all events, otherwise than as a
      councilor of parliament?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you are right; I do not see five francs difference between them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You understand; if I have a fine fish, I pay four or five francs for it;
      if I get a fine fowl, it cost me a franc and a half. I fatten a good deal
      of poultry, but I have to buy grain, and you cannot imagine the army of
      rats that infest this place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not get half a dozen cats to deal with them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cats, indeed; yes, they eat them, but I was obliged to give up the idea
      because of the way in which they treated my grain. I have been obliged to
      have some terrier dogs sent me from England to kill the rats. These dogs,
      unfortunately, have tremendous appetites; they eat as much as a prisoner
      of the fifth order, without taking into account the rabbits and fowls they
      kill."
    </p>
    <p>
      Was Aramis really listening or not? No one could have told; his downcast
      eyes showed the attentive man, but the restless hand betrayed the man
      absorbed in thought&mdash;Aramis was meditating.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was saying," continued Baisemeaux, "that a good-sized fowl costs me a
      franc and a half, and that a fine fish costs me four or five francs. Three
      meals are served at the Bastile, and, as the prisoners, having nothing to
      do, are always eating, a ten-franc man costs me seven francs and a half."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But did you not say that you treated those at ten francs like those at
      fifteen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well! Then you gain seven francs and a half upon those who pay you
      fifteen francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>must</i> compensate myself somehow," said Baisemeaux, who saw how he
      had been snapped up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite right, my dear governor; but have you no prisoners below
      ten francs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes! we have citizens and barristers at five francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do they eat, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a doubt about it; only you understand that they do not get fish or
      poultry, nor rich wines at every meal; but at all events thrice a week
      they have a good dish at their dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, you are quite a philanthropist, my dear governor, and you will
      ruin yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; understand me; when the fifteen-franc has not eaten his fowl, or the
      ten-franc has left his dish unfinished, I send it to the five-franc
      prisoner; it is a feast for the poor devil, and one must be charitable,
      you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what do you make out of your five-franc prisoners?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A franc and a half."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Baisemeaux, you're an honest fellow; in honest truth I say so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my lord. But I feel most for the small tradesmen and bailiffs'
      clerks, who are rated at three francs. They do not often see Rhine carp or
      Channel sturgeon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But do not the five-franc gentlemen sometimes leave some scraps?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! my lord, do not believe I am so stingy as that; I delight the heart
      of some poor little tradesman or clerk by sending him a wing of a red
      partridge, a slice of venison, or a slice of a truffled pasty, dishes
      which he never tasted except in his dreams; these are the leavings of the
      twenty-four-franc prisoners; and as he eats and drinks, at dessert he
      cries 'Long live the King,' and blesses the Bastile; with a couple bottles
      of champagne, which cost me five sous, I make him tipsy every Sunday. That
      class of people call down blessings upon me, and are sorry to leave the
      prison. Do you know that I have remarked, and it does me infinite honor,
      that certain prisoners, who have been set at liberty, have, almost
      immediately afterwards, got imprisoned again? Why should this be the case,
      unless it be to enjoy the pleasures of my kitchen? It is really the fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis smiled with an expression of incredulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You smile," said Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," returned Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you that we have names which have been inscribed on our books
      thrice in the space of two years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must see it before I believe it," said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I can show it to you, although it is prohibited to communicate the
      registers to strangers; and if you really wish to see it with your own
      eyes&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be delighted, I confess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said Baisemeaux, and he took out of a cupboard a large
      register. Aramis followed him most anxiously with his eyes, and Baisemeaux
      returned, placed the register upon the table, and turned over the leaves
      for a minute, and stayed at the letter M.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here," said he, "Martinier, January, 1659; Martinier, June, 1660;
      Martinier, March, 1661. Mazarinades, etc.; you understand it was only a
      pretext; people were not sent to the Bastile for jokes against M. Mazarin;
      the fellow denounced himself in order to get imprisoned here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what was his object?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None other than to return to my kitchen at three francs a day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three francs&mdash;poor devil!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The poet, my lord, belongs to the lowest scale, the same style of board
      as the small tradesman and bailiff's clerk; but I repeat, it is to those
      people that I give these little surprises."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis mechanically turned over the leaves of the register, continuing to
      read the names, but without appearing to take any interest in the names he
      read.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In 1661, you perceive," said Baisemeaux, "eighty entries; and in 1659,
      eighty also."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Aramis. "Seldon; I seem to know that name. Was it not you who
      spoke to me about a certain young man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, a poor devil of a student, who made&mdash;What do you call that
      where two Latin verses rhyme together?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A distich."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; that is it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor fellow; for a distich."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know that he made this distich against the Jesuits?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That makes no difference; the punishment seems very severe. Do not pity
      him; last year you seemed to interest yourself in him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I did so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as your interest is all-powerful here, my lord, I have treated him
      since that time as a prisoner at fifteen francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same as this one, then," said Aramis, who had continued turning over
      the leaves, and who had stopped at one of the names which followed
      Martinier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, the same as that one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that Marchiali an Italian?" said Aramis, pointing with his finger to
      the name which had attracted his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" said Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why hush?" said Aramis, involuntarily clenching his white hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I had already spoken to you about that Marchiali."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, it is the first time I ever heard his name pronounced."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may be, but perhaps I have spoken to you about him without naming
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he an old offender?" asked Aramis, attempting to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, he is quite young."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is his crime, then, very heinous?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unpardonable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he assassinated any one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An incendiary, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he slandered any one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no! It is he who&mdash;" and Baisemeaux approached Aramis's ear,
      making a sort of ear-trumpet of his hands, and whispered: "It is he who
      presumes to resemble the&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," said Aramis; "I now remember you already spoke about it last
      year to me; but the crime appeared to me so slight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slight, do you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or rather, so involuntary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, it is not involuntarily that such a resemblance is detected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the fact is, I had forgotten it. But, my dear host," said Aramis,
      closing the register, "if I am not mistaken, we are summoned."
    </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux took the register, hastily restored it to its place in the
      closet, which he locked, and put the key in his pocket. "Will it be
      agreeable to your lordship to breakfast now?" said he; "for you are right
      in supposing that breakfast was announced."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assuredly, my dear governor," and they passed into the dining-room.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXIV. The Breakfast at Monsieur de Baisemeaux's.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Aramis was generally temperate; but on this occasion, while taking every
      care of his constitution, he did ample justice to Baisemeaux's breakfast,
      which, in all respects, was most excellent. The latter on his side, was
      animated with the wildest gayety; the sight of the five thousand pistoles,
      which he glanced at from time to time, seemed to open his heart. Every now
      and then he looked at Aramis with an expression of the deepest gratitude;
      while the latter, leaning back in his chair, took a few sips of wine from
      his glass, with the air of a connoisseur. "Let me never hear any ill words
      against the fare of the Bastile," said he, half closing his eyes; "happy
      are the prisoners who can get only half a bottle of such Burgundy every
      day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All those at fifteen francs drink it," said Baisemeaux. "It is very old
      Volnay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does that poor student, Seldon, drink such good wine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I heard you say he was boarded at fifteen francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He! no, indeed; a man who makes districts&mdash;distichs I mean&mdash;at
      fifteen francs! No, no! it is his neighbor who is at fifteen francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which neighbor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The other, second Bertaudiere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, my dear governor; but you speak a language which requires
      quite an apprenticeship to understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true," said the governor. "Allow me to explain: second Bertaudiere
      is the person who occupies the second floor of the tower of the
      Bertaudiere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that Bertaudiere is the name of one of the towers of the Bastile? The
      fact is, I think I recollect hearing that each tower has a name of its
      own. Whereabouts is the one you are speaking of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look," said Baisemeaux, going to the window. "It is that tower to the
      left&mdash;the second one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the prisoner at fifteen francs there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since when?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seven or eight years, nearly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by nearly? Do you not know the dates more precisely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not in my time, M. d'Herblay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I should have thought that Louviere or Tremblay would have told you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The secrets of the Bastile are never handed over with the keys of the
      governorship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! Then the cause of his imprisonment is a mystery&mdash;a state
      secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no! I do not suppose it is a state secret, but a secret&mdash;like
      everything that happens at the Bastile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Aramis, "why do you speak more freely of Seldon than of second
      Bertaudiere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, in my opinion, the crime of the man who writes a distich is not
      so great as that of the man who resembles&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes; I understand you. Still, do not the turnkeys talk with your
      prisoners?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The prisoners, I suppose, tell them they are not guilty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are <i>always</i> telling them that; it is a matter of course; the
      same song over and over again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But does not the resemblance you were speaking about just now strike the
      turnkeys?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear M. d'Herblay, it is only for men attached to the court, as you
      are, to take trouble about such matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're right, you're right, my dear M. Baisemeaux. Let me give you
      another taste of this Volnay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a taste merely, a full glass; fill yours too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay! You are a musketeer still, to the very tips of your fingers,
      while I have become a bishop. A taste for me; a glass for yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you please." And Aramis and the governor nodded to each other, as they
      drank their wine. "But," said Aramis, looking with fixed attention at the
      ruby-colored wine he had raised to the level of his eyes, as if he wished
      to enjoy it with all his senses at the same moment, "but what you might
      call a resemblance, another would not, perhaps, take any notice of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most certainly he would, though, if it were any one who knew the person
      he resembles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really think, dear M. Baisemeaux, that it can be nothing more than a
      resemblance of your own creation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my honor, it is not so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay," continued Aramis. "I have seen many persons very like the one we
      are speaking of; but, out of respect, no one ever said anything about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely; because there is resemblance and resemblance. This is a
      striking one, and, if you were to see him, you would admit it to be so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I were to see him, indeed," said Aramis, in an indifferent tone; "but
      in all probability I never shall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because if I were even to put my foot inside one of those horrible
      dungeons, I should fancy I was buried there forever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; the cells are very good places to live in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I really do not, and cannot believe it, and that is a fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray do not speak ill of second Bertaudiere. It is really a good room,
      very nicely furnished and carpeted. The young fellow has by no means been
      unhappy there; the best lodging the Bastile affords has been his. There is
      a chance for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay," said Aramis, coldly; "you will never make me believe there are
      any good rooms in the Bastile; and, as for your carpets, they exist only
      in your imagination. I should find nothing but spiders, rats, and perhaps
      toads, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Toads?" cried Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, in the dungeons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! I don't say there are not toads in the dungeons," replied Baisemeaux.
      "But&mdash;will you be convinced by your own eyes?" he continued, with a
      sudden impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, certainly not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even to satisfy yourself of the resemblance which you deny, as you do
      the carpets?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some spectral-looking person, a mere shadow; an unhappy, dying man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the kind&mdash;as brisk and vigorous a young fellow as ever
      lived."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Melancholy and ill-tempered, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all; very gay and lively."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense; you are joking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you follow me?" said Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To go the round of the Bastile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will then see for yourself&mdash;see with your own eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the regulations?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind them. To-day my major has leave of absence; the lieutenant is
      visiting the post on the bastions; we are sole masters of the situation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, my dear governor; why, the very idea of the sound of the bolts
      makes me shudder. You will only have to forget me in second or fourth
      Bertaudiere, and then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are refusing an opportunity that may never present itself again. Do
      you know that, to obtain the favor I propose to you gratis, some of the
      princes of the blood have offered me as much as fifty thousand francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really! he must be worth seeing, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forbidden fruit, my lord; forbidden fruit. You who belong to the church
      ought to know that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if had any curiosity, it would be to see the poor author of the
      distich."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, we will see him, too; but if I were at all curious, it would
      be about the beautiful carpeted room and its lodger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Furniture is very commonplace; and a face with no expression in it offers
      little or no interest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But a boarder at fifteen francs is always interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the by, I forgot to ask you about that. Why fifteen francs for him,
      and only three francs for poor Seldon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The distinction made in that instance was a truly noble act, and one
      which displayed the king's goodness of heart to great advantage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king's, you say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The cardinal's, I mean. 'This unhappy man,' said M. Mazarin, 'is destined
      to remain in prison forever.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, it seems that his crime is a lasting one; and, consequently, his
      punishment ought to be so, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lasting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt of it, unless he is fortunate enough to catch the small-pox, and
      even that is difficult, for we never get any impure air here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing can be more ingenious than your train of reasoning, my dear M.
      Baisemeaux. Do you, however, mean to say that this unfortunate man must
      suffer without interruption or termination?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not say he was to suffer, my lord; a fifteen-franc boarder does not
      suffer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He suffers imprisonment, at all events."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt; there is no help for that, but this suffering is sweetened for
      him. You must admit that this young fellow was not born to eat all the
      good things he does eat; for instance, such things as we have on the table
      now; this pasty that has not been touched, these crawfish from the River
      Marne, of which we have hardly taken any, and which are almost as large as
      lobsters; all these things will at once be taken to second Bertaudiere,
      with a bottle of that Volnay which you think so excellent. After you have
      seen it you will believe it, I hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my dear governor, certainly; but all this time you are thinking only
      of your very happy fifteen-franc prisoner, and you forget poor Seldon, my
      <i>protege</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, out of consideration for you, it shall be a gala day for him; he
      shall have some biscuits and preserves with this small bottle of port."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a good-hearted fellow; I have said so already, and I repeat it,
      my dear Baisemeaux."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let us set off, then," said the governor, a little bewildered,
      partly from the wine he had drunk, and partly from Aramis's praises.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not forget that I only go to oblige you," said the prelate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; but you will thank me when you get there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us go, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait until I have summoned the jailer," said Baisemeaux, as he struck the
      bell twice; at which summons a man appeared. "I am going to visit the
      towers," said the governor. "No guards, no drums, no noise at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I were not to leave my cloak here," said Aramis, pretending to be
      alarmed, "I should really think I was going to prison on my own account."
    </p>
    <p>
      The jailer preceded the governor, Aramis walking on his right hand; some
      of the soldiers who happened to be in the courtyard drew themselves up in
      a line, as stiff as posts, as the governor passed along. Baisemeaux led
      the way down several steps which conducted to a sort of esplanade; thence
      they arrived at the drawbridge, where the sentinels on duty received the
      governor with the proper honors. The governor turned toward Aramis, and,
      speaking in such a tone that the sentinels could not lose a word, he
      observed,&mdash;"I hope you have a good memory, monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" inquired Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On account of your plans and your measurements, for you know that no one
      is allowed, not architects even, to enter where the prisoners are, with
      paper, pens or pencil."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good," said Aramis to himself, "it seems I am an architect, then. It
      sounds like one of D'Artagnan's jokes, who perceived in me the engineer of
      Belle-Isle." Then he added aloud: "Be easy on that score, monsieur; in our
      profession, a mere glance and a good memory are quite sufficient."
    </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux did not change countenance, and the soldiers took Aramis for
      what he seemed to be. "Very well; we will first visit la Bertaudiere,"
      said Baisemeaux, still intending the sentinels to hear him. Then, turning
      to the jailer, he added: "You will take the opportunity of carrying to No.
      2 the few dainties I pointed out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear M. de Baisemeaux," said Aramis, "you are always forgetting No. 3."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I am," said the governor; and upon that, they began to ascend. The
      number of bolts, gratings, and locks for this single courtyard would have
      sufficed for the safety of an entire city. Aramis was neither an
      imaginative nor a sensitive man; he had been somewhat of a poet in his
      youth, but his heart was hard and indifferent, as the heart of every man
      of fifty-five years of age is, who has been frequently and passionately
      attached to women in his lifetime, or rather who has been passionately
      loved by them. But when he placed his foot upon the worn stone steps,
      along which so many unhappy wretches had passed, when he felt himself
      impregnated, as it were, with the atmosphere of those gloomy dungeons,
      moistened with tears, there could be but little doubt he was overcome by
      his feelings, for his head was bowed and his eyes became dim, as he
      followed Baisemeaux without a syllable.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXV. The Second Floor of la Bertaudiere.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the second flight of stairs, whether from fatigue or emotion, the
      breathing of the visitor began to fail him, and he leaned against the
      wall. "Will you begin with this one?" said Baisemeaux; "for since we are
      going to both, it matters very little whether we ascend from the second to
      the third story, or descend from the third to the second."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," exclaimed Aramis, eagerly, "higher, if you please; the one above
      is the more urgent." They continued their ascent. "Ask the jailer for the
      keys," whispered Aramis. Baisemeaux did so, took the keys, and, himself,
      opened the door of the third room. The jailer was the first to enter; he
      placed upon the table the provisions, which the kind-hearted governor
      called dainties, and then left the room. The prisoner had not stirred;
      Baisemeaux then entered, while Aramis remained at the threshold, from
      which place he saw a youth about eighteen years of age, who, raising his
      head at the unusual noise, jumped off the bed, as he perceived the
      governor, and clasping his hands together, began to cry out, "My mother,
      my mother," in tones which betrayed such deep distress that Aramis,
      despite his command over himself, felt a shudder pass through his frame.
      "My dear boy," said Baisemeaux, endeavoring to smile, "I have brought you
      a diversion and an extra,&mdash;the one for the mind, the other for the
      body; this gentleman has come to take your measure, and here are some
      preserves for your dessert."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, monsieur!" exclaimed the young man, "keep me in solitude for a year,
      let me have nothing but bread and water for a year, but tell me that at
      the end of a year I shall leave this place, tell me that at the end of a
      year I shall see my mother again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I have heard you say that your mother was very poor, and that you
      were very badly lodged when you were living with her, while here&mdash;upon
      my word!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she were poor, monsieur, the greater reason to restore her only means
      of support to her. Badly lodged with her! Oh, monsieur, every one is
      always well lodged when he is free."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events, since you yourself admit you have done nothing but write
      that unhappy distich&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But without any intention, I swear. Let me be punished&mdash;cut off the
      hand which wrote it, I will work with the other&mdash;but restore my
      mother to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My boy," said Baisemeaux, "you know very well that it does not depend
      upon me; all I can do for you is to increase your rations, give you a
      glass of port wine now and then, slip in a biscuit for you between a
      couple of plates."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great heaven!" exclaimed the young man, falling backward and rolling on
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis, unable to bear this scene any longer, withdrew as far as the
      landing. "Unhappy, wretched man," he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, monsieur, he is indeed very wretched," said the jailer; "but it is
      his parents' fault."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt. Why did they let him learn Latin? Too much knowledge, you see;
      it is that which does harm. Now I, for instance, can't read or write, and
      therefore I am not in prison." Aramis looked at the man, who seemed to
      think that being a jailer in the Bastile was not being in prison. As for
      Baisemeaux, noticing the little effect produced by his advice and his port
      wine, he left the dungeon quite upset. "You have forgotten to close the
      door," said the jailer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I have," said Baisemeaux; "there are the keys, do you do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will solicit the pardon of that poor boy," said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if you do not succeed," said Baisemeaux, "at least beg that he may be
      transferred to the ten-franc list, by which both he and I shall be
      gainers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the other prisoner calls out for his mother in a similar manner," said
      Aramis, "I prefer not to enter at all, but will take my measure from
      outside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No fear of that, monsieur architect, the one we are now going to see is
      as gentle as a lamb; before he could call after his mother he must open
      his lips, and he never says a word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us go in, then," said Aramis, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you the architect of the prisons, monsieur?" said the jailer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is odd, then, that you are not more accustomed to all this."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis perceived that, to avoid giving rise to any suspicions, he must
      summon all his strength of mind to his assistance. Baisemeaux, who carried
      the keys, opened the door. "Stay outside," he said to the jailer, "and
      wait for us at the bottom of the steps." The jailer obeyed and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baisemeaux entered first, and opened the second door himself. By the light
      which filtered through the iron-barred window, could be seen a handsome
      young man, short in stature, with closely cut hair, and a beard beginning
      to grow; he was sitting on a stool, his elbow resting on an armchair, and
      with all the upper part of his body reclining against it. His dress,
      thrown upon the bed, was of rich black velvet, and he inhaled the fresh
      air which blew in upon his breast through a shirt of the very finest
      cambric. As the governor entered, the young man turned his head with a
      look full of indifference; and on recognizing Baisemeaux, he arose and
      saluted him courteously. But when his eyes fell upon Aramis, who remained
      in the background, the latter trembled, turned pale, and his hat, which he
      held in his hand, fell upon the ground, as if all his muscles had become
      relaxed at once. Baisemeaux, habituated to the presence of his prisoner,
      did not seem to share any of the sensations which Aramis experienced, but,
      with all the zeal of a good servant, he busied himself in arranging on the
      table the pasty and crawfish he had brought with him. Occupied in this
      manner, he did not remark how disturbed his guest had become. When he had
      finished, however, he turned to the young prisoner and said: "You are
      looking very well,&mdash;are you so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite well, I thank you, monsieur," replied the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of the voice was such as almost to overpower Aramis, and
      notwithstanding his control over himself, he advanced a few steps towards
      him, with his eyes wide open and his lips trembling. The movement he made
      was so marked that Baisemeaux, notwithstanding his preoccupation, observed
      it. "This gentleman is an architect who has come to examine your chimney,"
      said Baisemeaux; "does it smoke?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were saying just now," said the governor, rubbing his hands together,
      "that it was not possible for a man to be happy in prison; here, however,
      is one who is so. You have nothing to complain of, I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you ever feel weary?" said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, ha," said Baisemeaux, in a low tone of voice; "was I right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear governor, it is impossible not to yield to evidence. Is it
      allowed to put any question to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As many as you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; be good enough to ask him if he knows why he is here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This gentleman requests me to ask you," said Baisemeaux, "if you are
      aware of the cause of your imprisonment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, monsieur," said the young man, unaffectedly, "I am not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is hardly possible," said Aramis, carried away by his feelings in
      spite of himself; "if you were really ignorant of the cause of your
      detention, you would be furious."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was so during the early days of my imprisonment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why are you not so now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I have reflected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is strange," said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not odd?" said Baisemeaux.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May one venture to ask you, monsieur, on what you have reflected?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I felt that as I had committed no crime, Heaven could not punish me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is a prison, then," inquired Aramis, "if it be not a punishment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! I cannot tell," said the young man; "all that I can tell you now is
      the very opposite of what I felt seven years ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To hear you converse, to witness your resignation, one might almost
      believe that you liked your imprisonment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I endure it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the certainty of recovering your freedom some day, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no certainty; hope, I have, and that is all; and yet I acknowledge
      that this hope becomes less every day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, why should you not again be free, since you have already been so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is precisely the reason," replied the young man, "which prevents me
      from expecting liberty; why should I have been imprisoned at all if it had
      been intended to release me afterwards?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How old are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have forgotten the name by which I was called."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are your parents?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never knew them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But those who brought you up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They did not call me their son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you ever love any one before coming here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I loved my nurse, and my flowers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was that all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I also loved my valet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you regret your nurse and your valet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wept very much when they died."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did they die since you have been here, or before you came?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They died the evening before I was carried off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Both at the same time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, both at the same time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what manner were you carried off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man came for me, directed me to get into a carriage, which was closed
      and locked, and brought me here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you be able to recognize that man again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was masked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this not an extraordinary tale?" said Baisemeaux, in a low tone of
      voice, to Aramis, who could hardly breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is indeed extraordinary," he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what is still more extraordinary is, that he has never told me so
      much as he has just told you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps the reason may be that you have never questioned him," said
      Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's possible," replied Baisemeaux; "I have no curiosity. Have you looked
      at the room? it's a fine one, is it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very much so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A carpet&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beautiful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll wager he had nothing like it before he came here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think so, too." And then again turning towards the young man, he said,
      "Do you not remember to have been visited at some time or another by a
      strange lady or gentleman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed; thrice by a woman, who each time came to the door in a
      carriage, and entered covered with a veil, which she raised when we were
      together and alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remember that woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did she say to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man smiled mournfully, and then replied, "She inquired, as you
      have just done, if I were happy, and if I were getting weary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did she do on arriving, and on leaving you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She pressed me in her arms, held me in her embrace, and kissed me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you remember her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you recall her features distinctly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would recognize her, then, if accident brought her before you, or led
      you into her person?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      A flush of fleeting satisfaction passed across Aramis's face. At this
      moment Baisemeaux heard the jailer approaching. "Shall we leave?" he said,
      hastily, to Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis, who probably had learnt all that he cared to know, replied, "When
      you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man saw them prepare to leave, and saluted them politely.
      Baisemeaux replied merely by a nod of the head, while Aramis, with a
      respect, arising perhaps from the sight of such misfortune, saluted the
      prisoner profoundly. They left the room, Baisemeaux closing the door
      behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Baisemeaux, as they descended the staircase, "what do you
      think of it all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have discovered the secret, my dear governor," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah! what is the secret, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A murder was committed in that house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But attend; the valet and nurse died the same day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And by poison. What do you think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is very likely to be true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! that that young man is an assassin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who said that? What makes you think that poor young fellow could be an
      assassin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very thing I was saying. A crime was committed in his house," said
      Aramis, "and that was quite sufficient; perhaps he saw the criminals, and
      it was feared that he might say something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The deuce! if I only thought that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would redouble the surveillance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he does not seem to wish to escape."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not know what prisoners are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he any books?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None; they are strictly prohibited, and under M. de Mazarin's own hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you the writing still?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my lord; would you like to look at it as you return to take your
      cloak?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should, for I like to look at autographs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, this one is of the most unquestionable authenticity; there is
      only one erasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, ah! an erasure; and in what respect?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With respect to a figure. At first there was written: 'To be boarded at
      fifty francs.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As princes of the blood, in fact?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the cardinal must have seen his mistake, you understand; for he
      canceled the zero, and has added a one before the five. But, by the by&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not speak of the resemblance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not speak of it, dear M. de Baisemeaux, for a very simple reason&mdash;
      because it does not exist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The deuce it doesn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or, if it does exist, it is only in your own imagination; but, supposing
      it were to exist elsewhere, I think it would be better for you not to
      speak of about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king, Louis XIV.&mdash;you understand&mdash;would be excessively
      angry with you, if he were to learn that you contributed in any way to
      spread the report that one of his subjects has the effrontery to resemble
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true, quite true," said Baisemeaux, thoroughly alarmed; "but I have
      not spoken of the circumstance to any one but yourself, and you
      understand, monseigneur, that I perfectly rely on your discretion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, be easy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you still wish to see the note?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      While engaged in this manner in conversation, they had returned to the
      governor's apartments; Baisemeaux took from the cupboard a private
      register, like the one he had already shown Aramis, but fastened by a
      lock, the key which opened it being one of a small bunch which Baisemeaux
      always carried with him. Then placing the book upon the table, he opened
      it at the letter "M," and showed Aramis the following note in the column
      of observations: "No books at any time; all linen and clothes of the
      finest and best quality to be procured; no exercise; always the same
      jailer; no communications with any one. Musical instruments; every liberty
      and every indulgence which his welfare may require; to be boarded at
      fifteen francs. M. de Baisemeaux can claim more if the fifteen francs be
      not sufficient."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," said Baisemeaux, "now I think of it, I shall claim it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis shut the book. "Yes," he said, "it is indeed M. de Mazarin's
      handwriting; I recognize it well. Now, my dear governor," he continued, as
      if this last communication had exhausted his interest, "let us now turn
      over to our own little affairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what time for repayment do you wish me to take? Fix it yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There need not be any particular period fixed; give me a simple
      acknowledgement for one hundred and fifty thousand francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When to be made payable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I require it; but, you understand, I shall only wish it when you
      yourself do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I am quite easy on that score," said Baisemeaux, smiling; "but I have
      already given you two receipts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which I now destroy," said Aramis; and after having shown the two
      receipts to Baisemeaux, he destroyed them. Overcome by so great a mark of
      confidence, Baisemeaux unhesitatingly wrote out an acknowledgement of a
      debt of one hundred and fifty thousand francs, payable at the pleasure of
      the prelate. Aramis, who had, by glancing over the governor's shoulder,
      followed the pen as he wrote, put the acknowledgement into his pocket
      without seeming to have read it, which made Baisemeaux perfectly easy.
      "Now," said Aramis, "you will not be angry with me if I were to carry off
      one of your prisoners?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By obtaining his pardon, of course. Have I not already told you that I
      took a great interest in poor Seldon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, quite true, you did so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is your affair; do as you think proper. I see you have an open hand,
      and an arm that can reach a great way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adieu, adieu." And Aramis left, carrying with him the governor's best
      wishes.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXVI. The Two Friends.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the very time M. de Baisemeaux was showing Aramis the prisoners in the
      Bastile, a carriage drew up at Madame de Belliere's door, and, at that
      still early hour, a young woman alighted, her head muffled in a silk hood.
      When the servants announced Madame Vanel to Madame de Belliere, the latter
      was engaged, or rather was absorbed, in reading a letter, which she
      hurriedly concealed. She had hardly finished her morning toilette, her
      maid being still in the next room. At the name&mdash;at the footsteps of
      Marguerite Vanel, Madame de Belliere ran to meet her. She fancied she
      could detect in her friend's eyes a brightness which was neither that of
      health nor of pleasure. Marguerite embraced her, pressed her hands, and
      hardly allowed her time to speak. "Dearest," she said, "have you forgotten
      me? Have you quite given yourself up to the pleasures of the court?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not even seen the marriage <i>fetes</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing with yourself, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am getting ready to leave for Belliere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For Belliere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are becoming rustic in your tastes, then; I delight to see you so
      disposed. But you are pale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I am perfectly well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the better; I was becoming uneasy about you. You do not know what
      I have been told."
    </p>
    <p>
      "People say so many things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but this is very singular."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How well you know how to excite curiosity, Marguerite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I was afraid of vexing you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never; you have yourself always admired me for my evenness of temper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, it is said that&mdash;no, I shall never be able to tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not let us talk about it, then," said Madame de Belliere, who detected
      the ill-nature that was concealed by all these prefaces, yet felt the most
      anxious curiosity on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, my dear marquise, it is said, for some time past, you no
      longer continue to regret Monsieur de Belliere as you used to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is an ill-natured report, Marguerite. I do regret, and shall always
      regret, my husband; but it is now two years since he died. I am only
      twenty-eight years old, and my grief at his loss ought not always to
      control every action and thought of my life. You, Marguerite, who are the
      model of a wife, would not believe me if I were to say so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? Your heart is so soft and yielding," she said, spitefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours is so, too, Marguerite, and yet I did not perceive that you allowed
      yourself to be overcome by grief when your heart was wounded." These words
      were in direct allusion to Marguerite's rupture with the superintendent,
      and were also a veiled but direct reproach made against her friend's
      heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if she only awaited this signal to discharge her shaft, Marguerite
      exclaimed, "Well, Elise, it is said you are in love." And she looked
      fixedly at Madame de Belliere, who blushed against her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Women can never escape slander," replied the marquise, after a moment's
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one slanders you, Elise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!&mdash;people say that I am in love, and yet they do not slander
      me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place, if it be true, it is no slander, but simply a
      scandal-loving report. In the next place&mdash;for you did not allow me to
      finish what I was saying&mdash;the public does not assert that you have
      abandoned yourself to this passion. It represents you, on the contrary, as
      a virtuous but loving woman, defending yourself with claws and teeth,
      shutting yourself up in your own house as in a fortress; in other
      respects, as impenetrable as that of Danae, notwithstanding Danae's tower
      was made of brass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are witty, Marguerite," said Madame de Belliere, angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You always flatter me, Elise. In short, however, you are reported to be
      incorruptible and unapproachable. You cannot decide whether the world is
      calumniating you or not; but what is it you are musing about while I am
      speaking to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; you are blushing and do not answer me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was trying," said the marquise, raising her beautiful eyes brightened
      with an indication of growing temper, "I was trying to discover to what
      you could possibly have alluded, you who are so learned in mythological
      subjects, in comparing me to Danae."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were trying to guess that?" said Marguerite, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; do you not remember that at the convent, when we were solving our
      problems in arithmetic&mdash;ah! what I have to tell you is learned also,
      but it is my turn&mdash;do you not remember, that if one of the terms were
      given, we were to find the other? Therefore do <i>you</i> guess now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot conjecture what you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet nothing is more simple. You pretend that I am in love, do you
      not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; it is not said, I suppose, that I am in love with an
      abstraction. There must surely be a name mentioned in this report."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, a name is mentioned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; it is not surprising, then, that I should try to guess this
      name, since you do not tell it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear marquise, when I saw you blush, I did not think you would have to
      spend much time in conjectures."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was the word Danae which you used that surprised me. Danae means a
      shower of gold, does it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is to say that the Jupiter of Danae changed himself into a shower of
      gold for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lover, then, he whom you assign me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon; I am your friend, and assign you no one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may be; but those who are ill disposed towards me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you wish to hear the name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been waiting this half hour for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, you shall hear it. Do not be shocked; he is a man high in
      power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good," said the marquise, as she clenched her hands like a patient at the
      approach of the knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a very wealthy man," continued Marguerite; "the wealthiest, it may
      be. In a word, it is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquise closed her eyes for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the Duke of Buckingham," said Marguerite, bursting into laughter.
      This perfidy had been calculated with extreme ability; the name that was
      pronounced, instead of the name which the marquise awaited, had precisely
      the same effect upon her as the badly sharpened axes, that had hacked,
      without destroying, Messieurs de Chalais and de Thou upon the scaffold.
      She recovered herself, however, and said, "I was perfectly right in saying
      you were a witty woman, for you are making the time pass away most
      agreeably. This joke is a most amusing one, for I have never seen the Duke
      of Buckingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never?" said Marguerite, restraining her laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never even left my own house since the duke has been at Paris."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" resumed Madame Vanel, stretching out her foot towards a paper which
      was lying on the carpet near the window; "it is not necessary for people
      to see each other, since they can write." The marquise trembled, for this
      paper was the envelope of the letter she was reading as her friend had
      entered, and was sealed with the superintendent's arms. As she leaned back
      on the sofa on which she was sitting, Madame de Belliere covered the paper
      with the thick folds of her large silk dress, and so concealed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Marguerite, tell me, is it to tell me all these foolish reports
      that you have come to see me so early in the day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I came to see you, in the first place, and to remind you of those
      habits of our earlier days, so delightful to remember, when we used to
      wander about together at Vincennes, and, sitting beneath an oak, or in
      some sylvan shade, used to talk of those we loved, and who loved us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you propose that we should go out together now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My carriage is here, and I have three hours at my disposal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not dressed yet, Marguerite; but if you wish that we should talk
      together, we can, without going to the woods of Vincennes, find in my own
      garden here, beautiful trees, shady groves, a green sward covered with
      daisies and violets, the perfume of which can be perceived from where we
      are sitting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I regret your refusal, my dear marquise, for I wanted to pour out my
      whole heart into yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I repeat again, Marguerite, my heart is yours just as much in this room,
      or beneath the lime-trees in the garden here, as it would be under the
      oaks in the woods yonder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not the same thing for me. In approaching Vincennes, marquise, my
      ardent aspirations approach nearer to that object towards which they have
      for some days past been directed." The marquise suddenly raised her head.
      "Are you surprised, then, that I am still thinking of Saint-Mande?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of Saint-Mande?" exclaimed Madame de Belliere; and the looks of both
      women met each other like two resistless swords.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, so proud!" said the marquise, disdainfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, so proud!" replied Madame Vanel. "Such is my nature. I do not forgive
      neglect&mdash;I cannot endure infidelity. When I leave any one who weeps
      at my abandonment, I feel induced still to love him; but when others
      forsake me and laugh at their infidelity, I love distractedly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame de Belliere could not restrain an involuntary movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is jealous," said Marguerite to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," continued the marquise, "you are quite enamored of the Duke of
      Buckingham&mdash;I mean of M. Fouquet?" Elise felt the allusion, and her
      blood seemed to congeal in her heart. "And you wished to go to Vincennes,&mdash;to
      Saint-Mande, even?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly know what I wished: you would have advised me perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what respect?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have often done so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most certainly I should not have done so in the present instance, for I
      do not forgive as you do. I am less loving, perhaps; when my heart has
      been once wounded, it remains so always."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But M. Fouquet has not wounded you," said Marguerite Vanel, with the most
      perfect simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You perfectly understand what I mean. M. Fouquet has not wounded me; I do
      not know of either obligation or injury received at his hands, but you
      have reason to complain of him. You are my friend, and I am afraid I
      should not advise you as you would like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! you are prejudging the case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sighs you spoke of just now are more than indications."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You overwhelm me," said the young woman suddenly, as if collecting her
      whole strength, like a wrestler preparing for a last struggle; "you take
      only my evil dispositions and my weaknesses into calculation, and do not
      speak of my pure and generous feelings. If, at this moment, I feel
      instinctively attracted towards the superintendent, if I even make an
      advance to him, which, I confess, is very probable, my motive for it is,
      that M. Fouquet's fate deeply affects me, and because he is, in my
      opinion, one of the most unfortunate men living."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said the marquise, placing her hand upon her heart, "something new,
      then, has occurred?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not know it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am utterly ignorant of everything about him," said Madame de Belliere,
      with the poignant anguish that suspends thought and speech, and even life
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place, then, the king's favor is entirely withdrawn from M.
      Fouquet, and conferred on M. Colbert."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is stated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very clear, since the discovery of the plot of Belle-Isle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was told that the discovery of the fortifications there had turned out
      to M. Fouquet's honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Marguerite began to laugh in so cruel a manner that Madame de Belliere
      could at that moment have delightedly plunged a dagger in her bosom.
      "Dearest," continued Marguerite, "there is no longer any question of M.
      Fouquet's honor; his safety is concerned. Before three days are passed the
      ruin of the superintendent will be complete."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay," said the marquise, in her turn smiling, "that is going a little
      fast."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said three days, because I wish to deceive myself with a hope; but
      probably the catastrophe will be complete within twenty-four hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the simplest of all reasons,&mdash;that M. Fouquet has no more
      money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In matters of finance, my dear Marguerite, some are without money to-day,
      who to-morrow can procure millions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That might be M. Fouquet's case when he had two wealthy and clever
      friends who amassed money for him, and wrung it from every possible or
      impossible source; but those friends are dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Money does not die, Marguerite; it may be concealed, but it can be looked
      for, bought and found."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see things on the bright side, and so much the better for you. It is
      really very unfortunate that you are not the Egeria of M. Fouquet; you
      might now show him the source whence he could obtain the millions which
      the king asked him for yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Millions!" said the marquise, in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Four&mdash;an even number."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Infamous!" murmured Madame de Belliere, tortured by her friend's
      merciless delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. Fouquet, I should think, must certainly have four millions," she
      replied, courageously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he has those which the king requires to-day," said Marguerite, "he
      will not, perhaps, possess those which the king will demand in a month or
      so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king will exact money from him again, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt; and that is my reason for saying that the ruin of poor M.
      Fouquet is inevitable. Pride will induce him to furnish the money, and
      when he has no more, he will fall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true," said the marquise, trembling; "the plan is a bold one; but
      tell me, does M. Colbert hate M. Fouquet so very much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think he does not like him. M. Colbert is powerful; he improves on
      close acquaintance; he has gigantic ideas, a strong will, and discretion;
      he will rise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will be superintendent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is probable. Such is the reason, my dear marquise, why I felt myself
      impressed in favor of that poor man, who once loved, and even adored me;
      and why, when I see him so unfortunate, I forgive his infidelity, which I
      have reason to believe he also regrets; and why, moreover, I should not
      have been disinclined to afford him some consolation, or some good advice;
      he would have understood the step I had taken, and would have thought
      kindly of me for it. It is gratifying to be loved, you know. Men value
      love more highly when they are no longer blinded by its influence."
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquise, bewildered and overcome by these cruel attacks, which had
      been calculated with the greatest nicety and precision, hardly knew what
      to answer in return; she even seemed to have lost all power of thought.
      Her perfidious friend's voice had assumed the most affectionate tone; she
      spoke as a woman, but concealed the instincts of a wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Madame de Belliere, who had a vague hope that Marguerite
      would cease to overwhelm a vanquished enemy, "why do you not go and see M.
      Fouquet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Decidedly, marquise, you have made me reflect. No, it would be unbecoming
      for me to make the first advance. M. Fouquet no doubt loves me, but he is
      too proud. I cannot expose myself to an affront.... besides, I have my
      husband to consider. You tell me nothing? Very well, I shall consult M.
      Colbert on the subject." Marguerite rose smilingly, as though to take
      leave, but the marquise had not the strength to imitate her. Marguerite
      advanced a few paces, in order that she might continue to enjoy the
      humiliating grief in which her rival was plunged, and then said, suddenly,&mdash;"You
      do not accompany me to the door, then?" The marquise rose, pale and almost
      lifeless, without thinking of the envelope, which had occupied her
      attention so greatly at the commencement of the conversation, and which
      was revealed at the first step she took. She then opened the door of her
      oratory, and without even turning her head towards Marguerite Vanel,
      entered it, closing the door after her. Marguerite said, or rather
      muttered a few words, which Madame de Belliere did not even hear. As soon,
      however, as the marquise had disappeared, her envious enemy, not being
      able to resist the desire to satisfy herself that her suspicions were well
      founded, advanced stealthily like a panther, and seized the envelope.
      "Ah!" she said, gnashing her teeth, "it was indeed a letter from M.
      Fouquet she was reading when I arrived," and then darted out of the room.
      During this interval, the marquise, having arrived behind the rampart, as
      it were, of her door, felt that her strength was failing her; for a moment
      she remained rigid, pale and motionless as a statue, and then, like a
      statue shaken on its base by an earthquake, tottered and fell inanimate on
      the carpet. The noise of the fall resounded at the same moment as the
      rolling of Marguerite's carriage leaving the hotel.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXVII. Madame de Belliere's Plate.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The blow had been the more painful on account of its being unexpected. It
      was some time before the marquise recovered herself; but once recovered,
      she began to reflect upon the events so heartlessly announced to her. She
      therefore returned, at the risk even of losing her life in the way, to
      that train of ideas which her relentless friend had forced her to pursue.
      Treason, then&mdash;deep menaces, concealed under the semblance of public
      interest&mdash;such were Colbert's maneuvers. A detestable delight at an
      approaching downfall, untiring efforts to attain this object, means of
      seduction no less wicked than the crime itself&mdash;such were the weapons
      Marguerite employed. The crooked atoms of Descartes triumphed; to the man
      without compassion was united a woman without heart. The marquise
      perceived, with sorrow rather than indignation, that the king was an
      accomplice in the plot which betrayed the duplicity of Louis XIII. in his
      advanced age, and the avarice of Mazarin at a period of life when he had
      not had the opportunity of gorging himself with French gold. The spirit of
      this courageous woman soon resumed its energy, no longer overwhelmed by
      indulgence in compassionate lamentations. The marquise was not one to weep
      when action was necessary, nor to waste time in bewailing a misfortune as
      long as means still existed of relieving it. For some minutes she buried
      her face in her cold fingers, and then, raising her head, rang for her
      attendants with a steady hand, and with a gesture betraying a fixed
      determination of purpose. Her resolution was taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is everything prepared for my departure?" she inquired of one of her
      female attendants who entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madame; but it was not expected that your ladyship would leave for
      Belliere for the next few days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All my jewels and articles of value, then, are packed up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madame; but hitherto we have been in the habit of leaving them in
      Paris. Your ladyship does not generally take your jewels with you into the
      country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they are all in order, you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, in your ladyship's own room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gold plate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the chest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the silver plate?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the great oak closet."
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquise remained silent for a few moments, and then said calmly, "Let
      my goldsmith be sent for."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her attendants quitted the room to execute the order. The marquise,
      however, had entered her own room, and was inspecting her casket of jewels
      with the greatest attention. Never, until now, had she bestowed such close
      attention upon riches in which women take so much pride; never, until now,
      had she looked at her jewels, except for the purpose of making a selection
      according to their settings or their colors. On this occasion, however,
      she admired the size of the rubies and the brilliancy of the diamonds; she
      grieved over every blemish and every defect; she thought the gold light,
      and the stones wretched. The goldsmith, as he entered, found her thus
      occupied. "M. Faucheux," she said, "I believe you supplied me with my gold
      service?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did, your ladyship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not now remember the amount of the account."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the new service, madame, or of that which M. de Belliere presented to
      you on your marriage? for I have furnished both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "First of all, the new one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The covers, the goblets, and the dishes, with their covers, the <i>eau-epergne</i>,
      the ice-pails, the dishes for the preserves, and the tea and coffee urns,
      cost your ladyship sixty thousand francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your ladyship thought the account very high."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes; I remember, in fact, that it was dear; but it was the
      workmanship, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madame; the designs, the chasings&mdash;all new patterns."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What proportion of the cost does the workmanship form? Do not hesitate to
      tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A third of its value, madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is the other service, the old one, that which belonged to my
      husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madame; there is less workmanship in that than in the other. Its
      intrinsic value does not exceed thirty thousand francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thirty thousand," murmured the marquise. "But, M. Faucheux, there is also
      the service which belonged to my mother; all that massive plate which I
      did not wish to part with, on account of the associations connected with
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! madame, that would indeed be an excellent resource for those who,
      unlike your ladyship, might not be in position to keep their plate. In
      chasing that they worked in solid metal. But that service is no longer in
      fashion. Its weight is its only advantage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is all I care about. How much does it weigh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fifty thousand livres at the very least. I do not allude to the enormous
      vases for the buffet, which alone weigh five thousand livres, or ten
      thousand the pair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One hundred and thirty," murmured the marquise. "You are quite sure of
      your figures, M. Faucheux?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The amount is entered in my books. Your ladyship is extremely methodical,
      I am aware."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us now turn to another subject," said Madame de Belliere; and she
      opened one of her jewel-boxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I recognize these emeralds," said M. Faucheux; "for it was I who had the
      setting of them. They are the most beautiful in the whole court. No, I am
      mistaken; Madame de Chatillon has the most beautiful set; she had them
      from Messieurs de Guise; but your set, madame, comes next."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are they worth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mounted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; supposing I wished to sell them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know very well who would buy them," exclaimed M. Faucheux.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the very thing I ask. They could be sold, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All your jewels could be sold, madame. It is well known that you possess
      the most beautiful jewels in Paris. You are not changeable in your tastes;
      when you make a purchase it is of the very best; and what you purchase you
      do not part with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What could these emeralds be sold for, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A hundred and thirty thousand francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquise wrote down upon her tablets the amount which the jeweler
      mentioned. "The ruby necklace?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they balas-rubies, madame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here they are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are beautiful&mdash;magnificent. I did not know your ladyship had
      these stones."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is their value?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two hundred thousand francs. The center one is alone worth a hundred
      thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought so," said the marquise. "As for diamonds, I have them in
      numbers; rings, necklaces, sprigs, ear-rings, clasps. Tell me their value,
      M. Faucheux."
    </p>
    <p>
      The jeweler took his magnifying-glass and scales, weighed and inspected
      them, and silently made his calculations. "These stones," he said, "must
      have cost your ladyship an income of forty thousand francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You value them at eight hundred thousand francs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is about what I imagined&mdash;but the settings are not included?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madame; but if I were called upon to sell or to buy, I should be
      satisfied with the gold of the settings alone as my profit upon the
      transaction. I should make a good twenty-five thousand francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An agreeable sum."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very much so, madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you then accept that profit, then, on condition of converting the
      jewels into money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you do not intend to sell you diamonds, I suppose, madame?" exclaimed
      the bewildered jeweler.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silence, M. Faucheux, do not disturb yourself about that; give me an
      answer simply. You are an honorable man, with whom my family has dealt for
      thirty years; you knew my father and mother, whom your own father and
      mother served. I address you as a friend; will you accept the gold of the
      settings in return for a sum of ready money to be placed in my hands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eight hundred thousand francs! it is enormous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible to find."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But reflect, madame, upon the effect which will be produced by the sale
      of your jewels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one need know it. You can get sets of false jewels made for me,
      similar to the real. Do not answer a word; I insist upon it. Sell them
      separately, sell the stones only."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that way it is easy. Monsieur is looking out for some sets of jewels
      as well as single stones for Madame's toilette. There will be a
      competition for them. I can easily dispose of six hundred thousand francs'
      worth to Monsieur. I am certain yours are the most beautiful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When can you do so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In less than three days' time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, the remainder you will dispose of among private individuals.
      For the present, make me out a contract of sale, payment to be made in
      four days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I entreat you to reflect, madame; for if you force the sale, you will
      lose a hundred thousand francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If necessary, I will lose two hundred; I wish everything to be settled
      this evening. Do you accept?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, your ladyship. I will not conceal from you that I shall make fifty
      thousand francs by the transaction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the better for you. In what way shall I have the money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Either in gold, or in bills of the bank of Lyons, payable at M.
      Colbert's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I agree," said the marquise, eagerly; "return home and bring the sum in
      question in notes, as soon as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madame, but for Heaven's sake&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a word, M. Faucheux. By the by, I was forgetting the silver plate.
      What is the value of that which I have?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fifty thousand francs, madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That makes a million," said the marquise to herself. "M. Faucheux, you
      will take away with you both the gold and silver plate. I can assign, as a
      pretext, that I wish it remodeled on patters more in accordance with my
      own taste. Melt it down, and return me its value in money, at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall be done, your ladyship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be good enough to place the money in a chest, and direct one of
      your clerks to accompany the chest, and without my servants seeing him;
      and order him to wait for me in a carriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Madame de Faucheux's carriage?" said the jeweler.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will allow it, and I will call for it at your house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, your ladyship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will direct some of my servants to convey the plate to your house." The
      marquise rung. "Let the small van be placed at M. Faucheux's disposal,"
      she said. The jeweler bowed and left the house, directing that the van
      should follow him closely, saying aloud, that the marquise was about to
      have her plate melted down in order to have other plate manufactured of a
      more modern style. Three hours afterwards she went to M. Faucheux's house
      and received from him eight hundred francs in gold inclosed in a chest,
      which one of the clerks could hardly carry towards Madame Faucheux's
      carriage&mdash;for Madame Faucheux kept her carriage. As the daughter of a
      president of accounts, she had brought a marriage portion of thirty
      thousand crowns to her husband, who was syndic of the goldsmiths. These
      thirty thousand crowns had become very fruitful during twenty years. The
      jeweler, though a <i>millionaire</i>, was a modest man. He had purchased a
      substantial carriage, built in 1648, ten years after the king's birth.
      This carriage, or rather house upon wheels, excited the admiration of the
      whole quarter in which he resided&mdash;it was covered with allegorical
      paintings, and clouds scattered over with stars. The marquise entered this
      somewhat extraordinary vehicle, sitting opposite the clerk, who endeavored
      to put his knees out of the way, afraid even of touching the marquise's
      dress. It was the clerk, too, who told the coachman, who was very proud of
      having a marquise to drive, to take the road to Saint-Mande.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXVIII. The Dowry.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Monsieur Faucheux's horses were serviceable animals, with thickset knees
      and legs that had some difficulty in moving. Like the carriage, they
      belonged to the earlier part of the century. They were not as fleet as the
      English horses of M. Fouquet, and consequently it took two hours to get to
      Saint-Mande. Their progress, it might be said, was majestic. Majesty,
      however, precludes hurry. The marquise stopped the carriage at the door so
      well known to her, although she had seen it only once, under
      circumstances, it will now be remembered, no less painful than those which
      brought her now to it again. She drew a key from her pocket, and inserted
      it into the lock, pushed open the door, which noiselessly yielded to her
      touch, and directed the clerk to carry the chest upstairs to the first
      floor. The weight of the chest was so great that the clerk was obliged to
      get the coachman to assist him with it. They placed it in a small cabinet,
      ante-room, or boudoir rather, adjoining the saloon where we once saw M.
      Fouquet at the marquise's feet. Madame de Belliere gave the coachman a
      louis, smiled gracefully at the clerk, and dismissed them both. She closed
      the door after them, and waited in the room, alone and barricaded. There
      was no servant to be seen about the rooms, but everything was prepared as
      though some invisible genius had divined the wishes and desires of an
      expected guest. The fire was laid, candles in the candelabra, refreshments
      upon the table, books scattered about, fresh-cut flowers in the vases. One
      might almost have imagined it an enchanted house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marquise lighted the candles, inhaled the perfume of the flowers, sat
      down, and was soon plunged in profound thought. Her deep musings,
      melancholy though they were, were not untinged with a certain vague joy.
      Spread out before her was a treasure, a million wrung from her fortune as
      a gleaner plucks the blue corn-flower from her crown of flowers. She
      conjured up the sweetest dreams. Her principal thought, and one that took
      precedence of all others, was to devise means of leaving this money for M.
      Fouquet without his possibly learning from whom the gift had come. This
      idea, naturally enough, was the first to present itself to her mind. But
      although, on reflection, it appeared difficult to carry out, she did not
      despair of success. She would then ring to summon M. Fouquet and make her
      escape, happier than if, instead of having given a million, she had
      herself found one. But, being there, and having seen the boudoir so
      coquettishly decorated that it might almost be said the least particle of
      dust had but the moment before been removed by the servants; having
      observed the drawing-room, so perfectly arranged that it might almost be
      said her presence there had driven away the fairies who were its
      occupants, she asked herself if the glance or gaze of those whom she had
      displaced&mdash;whether spirits, fairies, elves, or human creatures&mdash;had
      not already recognized her. To secure success, it was necessary that some
      steps should be seriously taken, and it was necessary also that the
      superintendent should comprehend the serious position in which he was
      placed, in order to yield compliance with the generous fancies of a woman;
      all the fascinations of an eloquent friendship would be required to
      persuade him, and, should this be insufficient, the maddening influence of
      a devoted passion, which, in its resolute determination to carry
      conviction, would not be turned aside. Was not the superintendent, indeed,
      known for his delicacy and dignity of feeling? Would he allow himself to
      accept from any woman that of which she had stripped herself? No! He would
      resist, and if any voice in the world could overcome his resistance, it
      would be the voice of the woman he loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another doubt, and that a cruel one, suggested itself to Madame de
      Belliere with a sharp, acute pain, like a dagger thrust. Did he really
      love her? Would that volatile mind, that inconstant heart, be likely to be
      fixed for a moment, even were it to gaze upon an angel? Was it not the
      same with Fouquet, notwithstanding his genius and his uprightness of
      conduct, as with those conquerors on the field of battle who shed tears
      when they have gained a victory? "I must learn if it be so, and must judge
      of that for myself," said the marquise. "Who can tell whether that heart,
      so coveted, is not common in its impulses, and full of alloy? Who can tell
      if that mind, when the touchstone is applied to it, will not be found of a
      mean and vulgar character? Come, come," she said, "this is doubting and
      hesitation too much&mdash;to the proof," she said, looking at the
      timepiece. "It is now seven o'clock," she said; "he must have arrived; it
      is the hour for signing his papers." With a feverish impatience she rose
      and walked towards the mirror, in which she smiled with a resolute smile
      of devotedness; she touched the spring and drew out the handle of the
      bell. Then, as if exhausted beforehand by the struggle she had just
      undergone, she threw herself on her knees, in utter abandonment, before a
      large couch, in which she buried her face in her trembling hands. Ten
      minutes afterwards she heard the spring of the door sound. The door moved
      upon invisible hinges, and Fouquet appeared. He looked pale, and seemed
      bowed down by the weight of some bitter reflection. He did not hurry, but
      simply came at the summons. The preoccupation of his mind must indeed have
      been very great, that a man, so devoted to pleasure, for whom indeed
      pleasure meant everything, should obey such a summons so listlessly. The
      previous night, in fact, fertile in melancholy ideas, had sharpened his
      features, generally so noble in their indifference of expression, and had
      traced dark lines of anxiety around his eyes. Handsome and noble he still
      was, and the melancholy expression of his mouth, a rare expression with
      men, gave a new character to his features, by which his youth seemed to be
      renewed. Dressed in black, the lace in front of his chest much disarranged
      by his feverishly restless hand, the looks of the superintendent, full of
      dreamy reflection, were fixed upon the threshold of the room which he had
      so frequently approached in search of expected happiness. This gloomy
      gentleness of manner, this smiling sadness of expression, which had
      replaced his former excessive joy, produced an indescribable effect upon
      Madame de Belliere, who was regarding him at a distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A woman's eye can read the face of the man she loves, its every feeling of
      pride, its every expression of suffering; it might almost be said that
      Heaven has graciously granted to women, on account of their very weakness,
      more than it has accorded to other creatures. They can conceal their own
      feelings from a man, but from them no man can conceal his. The marquise
      divined in a single glace the whole weight of the unhappiness of the
      superintendent. She divined a night passed without sleep, a day passed in
      deceptions. From that moment she was firm in her own strength, and she
      felt that she loved Fouquet beyond everything else. She arose and
      approached him, saying, "You wrote to me this morning to say you were
      beginning to forget me, and that I, whom you had not seen lately, had no
      doubt ceased to think of you. I have come to undeceive you, monsieur, and
      the more completely so, because there is one thing I can read in your
      eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that, madame?" said Fouquet, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you have never loved me so much as at this moment; in the same
      manner you can read, in my present step towards you, that I have not
      forgotten you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! madame," said Fouquet, whose face was for a moment lighted up by a
      sudden gleam of joy, "you are indeed an angel, and no man can suspect you.
      All he can do is to humble himself before you and entreat forgiveness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your forgiveness is granted, then," said the marquise. Fouquet was about
      to throw himself upon his knees. "No, no," she said, "sit here by my side.
      Ah! that is an evil thought which has just crossed your mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you detect it, madame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the smile that has just marred the expression of your countenance. Be
      candid, and tell me what your thought was&mdash;no secrets between
      friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, then, madame, why you have been so harsh these three or four
      months past?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Harsh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; did you not forbid me to visit you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" said Madame de Belliere, sighing, "because your visit to me was
      the cause of your being visited with a great misfortune; because my house
      is watched; because the same eyes that have seen you already might see you
      again; because I think it less dangerous for you that I should come here
      than that you should come to my house; and, lastly, because I know you to
      be already unhappy enough not to wish to increase your unhappiness
      further."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet started, for these words recalled all the anxieties connected with
      his office of superintendent&mdash;he who, for the last few minutes, had
      indulged in all the wild aspirations of the lover. "I unhappy?" he said,
      endeavoring to smile: "indeed, marquise, you will almost make me believe I
      am so, judging from your own sadness. Are your beautiful eyes raised upon
      me merely in pity? I was looking for another expression from them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not I who am sad, monsieur; look in the mirror, there&mdash;it is
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true I am somewhat pale, marquise; but it is from overwork; the
      king yesterday required a supply of money from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, four millions; I am aware of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know it?" exclaimed Fouquet, in a tone of surprise; "how can you have
      learnt it? It was after the departure of the queen, and in the presence of
      one person only, that the king&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You perceive that I do know it; is that not sufficient? Well, go on,
      monsieur, the money the king has required you to supply&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You understand, marquise, that I have been obliged to procure it, then to
      get it counted, afterwards registered&mdash;altogether a long affair.
      Since Monsieur de Mazarin's death, financial affairs occasion some little
      fatigue and embarrassment. My administration is somewhat overtaxed, and
      this is the reason why I have not slept during the past night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you have the amount?" inquired the marquise, with some anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would indeed be strange, marquise," replied Fouquet, cheerfully, "if a
      superintendent of finances were not to have a paltry four millions in his
      coffers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, I believe you either have, or will have them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by saying I shall have them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not very long since you were required to furnish two millions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, it seems almost an age; but do not let us talk of money
      matters any longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, we will continue to speak of them, for that is my only
      reason for coming to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am at a loss to compass your meaning," said the superintendent, whose
      eyes began to express an anxious curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, monsieur, is the office of superintendent a permanent position?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You surprise me, marchioness, for you speak as if you had some motive or
      interest in putting the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My reason is simple enough; I am desirous of placing some money in your
      hands, and naturally I wish to know if you are certain of your post."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, marquise, I am at a loss what to reply; I cannot conceive your
      meaning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seriously, then, dear M. Fouquet, I have certain funds which somewhat
      embarrass me. I am tired of investing my money in lands, and am anxious to
      intrust it to some friend who will turn it to account."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely it does not press," said M. Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, it is very pressing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, we will talk of that by and by."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By and by will not do, for my money is there," returned the marquise,
      pointing out the coffer to the superintendent, and showing him, as she
      opened it, the bundles of notes and heaps of gold. Fouquet, who had risen
      from his seat at the same moment as Madame de Belliere, remained for a
      moment plunged in thought; then suddenly starting back, he turned pale,
      and sank down in his chair, concealing his face in his hands. "Madame,
      madame," he murmured, "what opinion can you have of me, when you make me
      such an offer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of you!" returned the marquise. "Tell me, rather, what you yourself think
      of the step I have taken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bring me this money for myself, and you bring it because you know me
      to be embarrassed. Nay, do not deny it, for I am sure of it. Can I not
      read your heart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you know my heart, then, can you not see that it is my heart I offer
      you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have guessed rightly, then," exclaimed Fouquet. "In truth, madame, I
      have never yet given you the right to insult me in this manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Insult you," she said, turning pale, "what singular delicacy of feeling!
      You tell me you love me; in the name of that affection you wish me to
      sacrifice my reputation and my honor, yet, when I offer you money which is
      my own, you refuse me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, you are at liberty to preserve what you term your reputation and
      your honor. Permit me to preserve mine. Leave me to my ruin, leave me to
      sink beneath the weight of the hatreds which surround me, beneath the
      faults I have committed, beneath the load, even, of my remorse, but, for
      Heaven's sake, madame, do not overwhelm me with this last infliction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A short time since, M. Fouquet, you were wanting in judgment; now you are
      wanting in feeling."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet pressed his clenched hand upon his breast, heaving with emotion,
      saying: "overwhelm me, madame, for I have nothing to reply."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I offered you my friendship, M. Fouquet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madame, and you limited yourself to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what I am now doing is the act of a friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you reject this mark of my friendship?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do reject it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Fouquet, look at me," said the marquise, with glistening eyes,
      "I now offer you my love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, madame," exclaimed Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have loved you for a long while past; women, like men, have a false
      delicacy at times. For a long time past I have loved you, but would not
      confess it. Well, then, you have implored this love on your knees, and I
      have refused you; I was blind, as you were a little while since; but as it
      was my love that you sought, it is my love I now offer you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! madame, you overwhelm me beneath a load of happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you be happy, then, if I am yours&mdash;entirely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be the supremest happiness for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take me, then. If, however, for your sake I sacrifice a prejudice, do
      you, for mine, sacrifice a scruple."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not tempt me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not refuse me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think seriously of what you are proposing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fouquet, but one word. Let it be 'No,' and I open this door," and she
      pointed to the door which led into the streets, "and you will never see me
      again. Let that word be 'Yes,' and I am yours entirely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Elise! Elise! But this coffer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Contains my dowry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is your ruin," exclaimed Fouquet, turning over the gold and papers;
      "there must be a million here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my jewels, for which I care no longer if you do not love me, and for
      which, equally, I care no longer if you love me as I love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is too much," exclaimed Fouquet. "I yield, I yield, even were it
      only to consecrate so much devotion. I accept the dowry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And take the woman with it," said the marquise, throwing herself into his
      arms.

      Chapter XXIX. Le Terrain de Dieu.
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the progress of these events Buckingham and De Wardes traveled in
      excellent companionship, and made the journey from Paris to Calais in
      undisturbed harmony together. Buckingham had hurried his departure, so
      that the greater part of his <i>adieux</i> were very hastily made. His
      visit to Monsieur and Madame, to the young queen, and to the
      queen-dowager, had been paid collectively&mdash;a precaution on the part
      of the queen-mother which saved him the distress of any private
      conversation with Monsieur, and also the danger of seeing Madame again.
      The carriages containing the luggage had already been sent on beforehand,
      and in the evening he set off in his traveling carriage with his
      attendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Wardes, irritated at finding himself dragged away in so abrupt a manner
      by this Englishman, had sought in his subtle mind for some means of
      escaping from his fetters; but no one having rendered him any assistance
      in this respect, he was absolutely obliged, therefore, to submit to the
      burden of his own evil thoughts and caustic spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such of his friends in whom he had been able to confide, had, in their
      character of wits, rallied him upon the duke's superiority. Others, less
      brilliant, but more sensible, had reminded him of the king's orders
      prohibiting dueling. Others, again, and they the larger number, who, in
      virtue of charity, or national vanity, might have rendered him assistance,
      did not care to run the risk of incurring disgrace, and would, at the
      best, have informed the ministers of a departure which might end in a
      massacre on a small scale. The result was, that, after having fully
      deliberated upon the matter, De Wardes packed up his luggage, took a
      couple of horses, and, followed only by one servant, made his way towards
      the barrier, where Buckingham's carriage was to await him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke received his adversary as he would have done an intimate
      acquaintance, made room beside him on the same seat with himself, offered
      him refreshments, and spread over his knees the sable cloak that had been
      thrown on the front seat. They then conversed of the court, without
      alluding to Madame; of Monsieur, without speaking of domestic affairs; of
      the king, without speaking of his brother's wife; of the queen-mother,
      without alluding to her daughter-in-law; of the king of England, without
      alluding to his sister; of the state of the affections of either of the
      travelers, without pronouncing any name that might be dangerous. In this
      way the journey, which was performed by short stages, was most agreeable,
      and Buckingham, almost a Frenchman from wit and education, was delighted
      at having so admirably selected his traveling companion. Elegant repasts
      were served, of which they partook but lightly; trials of horses made in
      the beautiful meadows that skirted the road; coursing indulged in, for
      Buckingham had his greyhounds with him; and in such ways did they pass
      away the pleasant time. The duke somewhat resembled the beautiful river
      Seine, which folds France a thousand times in its loving embrace, before
      deciding upon joining its waters with the ocean. In quitting France, it
      was her recently adopted daughter he had brought to Paris whom he chiefly
      regretted; his every thought was a remembrance of her&mdash;his every
      memory a regret. Therefore, whenever, now and then, despite his command
      over himself, he was lost in thought, De Wardes left him entirely to his
      musings. This delicacy might have touched Buckingham, and changed his
      feelings towards De Wardes, if the latter, while preserving silence, had
      shown a glance less full of malice, and a smile less false. Instinctive
      dislikes, however, are relentless; nothing appeases them; a few ashes may,
      sometimes, apparently, extinguish them; but beneath those ashes the
      smothered embers rage more furiously. Having exhausted every means of
      amusement the route offered, they arrived, as we have said, at Calais
      towards the end of the sixth day. The duke's attendants, since the
      previous evening, had traveled in advance, and now chartered a boat, for
      the purpose of joining the yacht, which had been tacking about in sight,
      or bore broadside on, whenever it felt its white wings wearied, within
      cannon-shot of the jetty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat was destined for the transport of the duke's equipages from the
      shore to the yacht. The horses had been embarked, having been hoisted from
      the boat upon the deck in baskets, expressly made for the purpose, and
      wadded in such a manner that their limbs, even in the most violent fits of
      terror or impatience, were always protected by the soft support which the
      sides afforded, and their coats not even turned. Eight of these baskets,
      placed side by side, filled the ship's hold. It is well known that, in
      short voyages horses refuse to eat, but remain trembling all the while,
      with the best of food before them, such as they would have greatly coveted
      on land. By degrees, the duke's entire equipage was transported on board
      the yacht; he was then informed that everything was in readiness, and that
      they only waited for him, whenever he would be disposed to embark with the
      French gentleman; for no one could possibly imagine that the French
      gentleman would have any other accounts to settle with his Grace other
      than those of friendship. Buckingham desired the captain to be told to
      hold himself in readiness, but that, as the sea was beautiful, and as the
      day promised a splendid sunset, he did not intend to go on board until
      nightfall, and would avail himself of the evening to enjoy a walk on the
      strand. He added also, that, finding himself in such excellent company, he
      had not the least desire to hasten his embarkation.
    </p>
<p>
As he said this he pointed out to those who surrounded him the
magnificent spectacle which the sky presented, of deepest azure in the
horizon, the amphitheatre of fleecy clouds ascending from the sun's disc
to the zenith, assuming the appearance of a range of snowy mountains,
whose summits were heaped one upon another. The dome of clouds was
tinged at its base with, as it were, the foam of rubies, fading away
into opal and pearly tints, in proportion as the gaze was carried from
base to summit. The sea was gilded with the same reflection, and upon
the crest of every sparkling wave danced a point of light, like a
diamond by lamplight. The mildness of the evening, the sea breezes, so
dear to contemplative minds, setting in from the east and blowing in
delicious gusts; then, in the distance, the black outline of the yacht
with its rigging traced upon the empurpled background of the sky&mdash;while,
dotting the horizon, might be seen, here and there, vessels with their
trimmed sails, like the wings of a seagull about to plunge; such a
spectacle indeed well merited admiration. A crowd of curious idlers
followed the richly dressed attendants, amongst whom they mistook
the steward and the secretary for the master and his friend. As for
Buckingham, who was dressed very simply, in a gray satin vest, and
doublet of violet-colored velvet, wearing his hat thrust over his eyes,
and without orders or embroidery, he was taken no more notice of than De
Wardes, who was in black, like an attorney.
</p>
    <p>
The duke's attendants had received directions to have a boat in
readiness at the jetty head, and to watch the embarkation of their
master, without approaching him until either he or his friend should
summon them,&mdash;"whatever may happen," he had added, laying a stress upon
these words, so that they might not be misunderstood. Having walked a
few paces upon the strand, Buckingham said to De Wardes, "I think it is
now time to take leave of each other. The tide, you perceive, is rising;
ten minutes hence it will have soaked the sands where we are now walking
in such a manner that we shall not be able to keep our footing."
</p>
    <p>
      "I await your orders, my lord, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, you mean, we are still upon soil which is part of the king's
      territory."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, do you see yonder a kind of little island surrounded by a circle of
      water? The pool is increasing every minute, and the isle is gradually
      disappearing. This island, indeed, belongs to Heaven, for it is situated
      between two seas, and is not shown on the king's charts. Do you observe
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but we can hardly reach it now, without getting our feet wet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but observe that it forms an eminence tolerably high, and that the
      tide rises up on every side, leaving the top free. We shall be admirably
      placed upon that little theatre. What do you think of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be perfectly happy wherever I may have the honor of crossing my
      sword with your lordship's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then, I am distressed to be the cause of your wetting your
      feet, M. de Wardes, but it is most essential you should be able to say to
      the king: 'Sire, I did not fight upon your majesty's territory.' Perhaps
      the distinction is somewhat subtle, but, since Port-Royal, your nation
      delights in subtleties of expression. Do not let us complain of this,
      however, for it makes your wit very brilliant, and of a style peculiarly
      your own. If you do not object, we will hurry ourselves, for the sea, I
      perceive, is rising fast, and night is setting in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My reason for not walking faster was, that I did not wish to precede your
      Grace. Are you still on dry land, my lord?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, at present I am. Look yonder! My servants are afraid we shall be
      drowned, and have converted the boat into a cruiser. Do you remark how
      curiously it dances upon the crests of the waves? But, as it makes me feel
      sea-sick, would you permit me to turn my back towards them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will observe, my lord, that in turning your back to them, you will
      have the sun full in your face."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, its rays are very feeble at this hour and it will soon disappear; do
      not be uneasy on that score."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you please, my lord; it was out of consideration for your lordship
      that I made the remark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am aware of that, M. de Wardes, and I fully appreciate your kindness.
      Shall we take off our doublets?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you please, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not hesitate to tell me, M. de Wardes, if you do not feel comfortable
      upon the wet sand, or if you think yourself a little too close to French
      territory. We could fight in England, or even upon my yacht."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are exceedingly well placed here, my lord; only I have the honor to
      remark that, as the sea is rising fast, we have hardly time&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Buckingham made a sign of assent, took off his doublet and threw it on the
      ground, a proceeding which De Wardes imitated. Both their bodies, which
      seemed like phantoms to those who were looking at them from the shore,
      were thrown strongly into relief by a dark red violet-colored shadow with
      which the sky became overspread.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word, your Grace," said De Wardes, "we shall hardly have time to
      begin. Do you not perceive how our feet are sinking into the sand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have sunk up to the ankles," said Buckingham, "without reckoning that
      the water is even now breaking in upon us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has already reached me. As soon as you please, therefore, your Grace,"
      said De Wardes, who drew his sword, a movement imitated by the duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Wardes," said Buckingham, "one final word. I am about to fight you
      because I do not like you,&mdash;because you have wounded me in ridiculing
      a certain devotional regard I have entertained, and one which I
      acknowledge that, at this moment, I still retain, and for which I would
      very willingly die. You are a bad and heartless man, M. de Wardes, and I
      will do my very utmost to take your life; for I feel assured that, if you
      survive this engagement, you will, in the future, work great mischief
      towards my friends. That is all I have to remark, M. de Wardes," concluded
      Buckingham as he saluted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I, my lord, have only this to reply to you: I have not disliked you
      hitherto, but, since you give me such a character, I hate you, and will do
      all I possibly can to kill you;" and De Wardes saluted Buckingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their swords crossed at the same moment, like two flashes of lightning on
      a dark night. The swords seemed to seek each other, guessed their
      position, and met. Both were practiced swordsmen, and the earlier passes
      were without any result. The night was fast closing in, and it was so dark
      that they attacked and defended themselves almost instinctively. Suddenly
      De Wardes felt his word arrested,&mdash;he had just touched Buckingham's
      shoulder. The duke's sword sunk, as his arm was lowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are wounded, my lord," said De Wardes, drawing back a step or two.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, monsieur, but only slightly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet you quitted your guard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only from the first effect of the cold steel, but I have recovered. Let
      us go on, if you please." And disengaging his sword with a sinister
      clashing of the blade, the duke wounded the marquis in the breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A hit?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," cried De Wardes, not moving from his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, but observing that your shirt was stained&mdash;" said
      Buckingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said De Wardes furiously, "it is now your turn."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a terrible lunge, he pierced Buckingham's arm, the sword passing
      between the two bones. Buckingham feeling his right arm paralyzed,
      stretched out his left, seized his sword, which was about falling from his
      nerveless grasp, and before De Wardes could resume his guard, he thrust
      him through the breast. De Wardes tottered, his knees gave way beneath
      him, and leaving his sword still fixed in the duke's arm, he fell into the
      water, which was soon crimsoned with a more genuine reflection than that
      which it had borrowed from the clouds. De Wardes was not dead; he felt the
      terrible danger that menaced him, for the sea rose fast. The duke, too,
      perceived the danger. With an effort and an exclamation of pain he tore
      out the blade which remained in his arm, and turning towards De Wardes
      said, "Are you dead, marquis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied De Wardes, in a voice choked by the blood which rushed from
      his lungs to his throat, "but very near it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what is to be done; can you walk?" said Buckingham, supporting him
      on his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible," he replied. Then falling down again, said, "call to your
      people, or I shall be drowned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Halloa! boat there! quick, quick!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat flew over the waves, but the sea rose faster than the boat could
      approach. Buckingham saw that De Wardes was on the point of being again
      covered by a wave; he passed his left arm, safe and unwounded, round his
      body and raised him up. The wave ascended to his waist, but did not move
      him. The duke immediately began to carry his late antagonist towards the
      shore. He had hardly gone ten paces, when a second wave, rushing onwards
      higher, more furious and menacing than the former, struck him at the
      height of his chest, threw him over and buried him beneath the water. At
      the reflux, however, the duke and De Wardes were discovered lying on the
      strand. De Wardes had fainted. At this moment four of the duke's sailors,
      who comprehended the danger, threw themselves into the sea, and in a
      moment were close beside him. Their terror was extreme when they observed
      how their master became covered with blood, in proportion to the water,
      with which it was impregnated, flowed towards his knees and feet; they
      wished to carry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," exclaimed the duke, "take the marquis on shore first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Death to the Frenchman!" cried the English sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wretched knaves!" exclaimed the duke, drawing himself up with a haughty
      gesture, which sprinkled them with blood, "obey directly! M. de Wardes on
      shore! M. de Wardes's safety to be looked to first, or I will have you all
      hanged!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The boat had by this time reached them; the secretary and steward leaped
      into the sea, and approached the marquis, who no longer showed any sign of
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I commit him to your care, as you value your lives," said the duke. "Take
      M. de Wardes on shore." They took him in their arms, and carried him to
      the dry sand, where the tide never rose so high. A few idlers and five or
      six fishermen had gathered on the shore, attracted by the strange
      spectacle of two men fighting with the water up to their knees. The
      fishermen, observing a group of men approaching carrying a wounded man,
      entered the sea until the water was up to their waists. The English
      transferred the wounded man to them, at the very moment the latter began
      to open his eyes again. The salt water and the fine sand had got into his
      wounds, and caused him the acutest pain. The duke's secretary drew out a
      purse filled with gold from his pocket, and handed it to the one among
      those present who appeared of most importance, saying: "From my master,
      his Grace the Duke of Buckingham, in order that every possible care may be
      taken of the Marquis de Wardes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, followed by those who had accompanied him, he returned to the boat,
      which Buckingham had been enabled to reach with the greatest difficulty,
      but only after he had seen De Wardes out of danger. By this time it was
      high tide; embroidered coats, and silk sashes were lost; many hats, too,
      had been carried away by the waves. The flow of the tide had borne the
      duke's and De Wardes's clothes to the shore, and De Wardes was wrapped in
      the duke's doublet, under the belief that it was his own, when the
      fishermen carried him in their arms towards the town.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXX. Threefold Love.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as Buckingham departed, Guiche imagined the coast would be
      perfectly clear for him without any interference. Monsieur, who no longer
      retained the slightest feeling of jealousy, and who, besides, permitted
      himself to be monopolized by the Chevalier de Lorraine, allowed as much
      liberty and freedom in his house as the most exacting could desire. The
      king, on his side, who had conceived a strong predilection for his
      sister-in-law's society, invented a variety of amusements, in quick
      succession to each other, in order to render her residence in Paris as
      cheerful as possible, so that in fact, not a day passed without a ball at
      the Palais Royal, or a reception in Monsieur's apartments. The king had
      directed that Fontainebleau should be prepared for the reception of the
      court, and every one was using his utmost interest to get invited. Madame
      led a life of incessant occupation; neither her voice nor her pen were
      idle for a moment. The conversations with De Guiche were gradually
      assuming a tone of interest which might unmistakably be recognized as the
      prelude of a deep-seated attachment. When eyes look languishingly while
      the subject under discussion happens to be colors of materials for
      dresses; when a whole hour is occupied in analyzing the merits and the
      perfume of a <i>sachet</i> or a flower;&mdash;there are words in this
      style of conversation which every one might listen to, but there are
      gestures and sighs that every one cannot perceive. After Madame had talked
      for some time with De Guiche, she conversed with the king, who paid her a
      visit regularly every day. They played, wrote verses, or selected mottoes
      or emblematical devices; this spring was not only the Maytide of nature,
      it was the youth of an entire people, of which those at court were the
      head. The king was handsome, young, and of unequaled gallantry. All women
      were passionately loved by him, even the queen, his wife. This mighty
      monarch was, however, more timid and more reserved than any other person
      in the kingdom, to such a degree, indeed, that he did not confess his
      sentiments even to himself. This timidity of bearing restrained him within
      the limits of ordinary politeness, and no woman could boast of having any
      preference shown her beyond that shown to others. It might be foretold
      that the day when his real character would be displayed would be the dawn
      of a new sovereignty; but as yet he had not declared himself. M. de Guiche
      took advantage of this, and constituted himself the sovereign prince of
      the whole laughter-loving court. It had been reported that he was on the
      best of terms with Mademoiselle de Montalais; that he had been assiduously
      attentive to Mademoiselle de Chatillon; but now he was not even barely
      civil to any of the court beauties. He had eyes and ears for one person
      alone. In this manner, and, as it were, without design, he devoted himself
      to Monsieur, who had a great regard for him, and kept him as much as
      possible in his own apartments. Unsociable from natural disposition, he
      had estranged himself too much previous to the arrival of Madame, but,
      after her arrival, he did not estrange himself sufficiently. This conduct,
      which every one had observed, had been particularly remarked by the evil
      genius of the house, the Chevalier de Lorraine, for whom Monsieur
      exhibited the warmest attachment because he was of a very cheerful
      disposition, even in his remarks most full of malice, and because he was
      never at a loss how to wile the time away. The Chevalier de Lorraine,
      therefore, having noticed that he was threatened with being supplanted by
      De Guiche, resorted to strong measures. He disappeared from the court,
      leaving Monsieur much embarrassed. The first day of his absence, Monsieur
      hardly inquired about him, for he had De Guiche with him, and, except that
      the time given to conversation with Madame, his days and nights were
      rigorously devoted to the prince. On the second day, however, Monsieur,
      finding no one near him, inquired where the chevalier was. He was told
      that no one knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche, after having spent the morning in selecting embroideries and
      fringes with Madame, went to console the prince. But after dinner, as
      there were some amethysts to be looked at, De Guiche returned to Madame's
      cabinet. Monsieur was left quite to himself during the time devoted to
      dressing and decorating himself; he felt that he was the most miserable of
      men, and again inquired whether there was any news of the chevalier, in
      reply to which he was told that no one could tell where the chevalier was
      to be found. Monsieur, hardly knowing in what direction to inflict his
      weariness, went to Madame's apartments dressed in his morning-gown. He
      found a large assemblage of people there, laughing and whispering in every
      part of the room; at one end, a group of women around one of the
      courtiers, talking together, amid smothered bursts of laughter; at the
      other end, Manicamp and Malicorne were being pillaged at cards by
      Montalais and Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, while two others were
      standing by, laughing. In another part were Madame, seated upon some
      cushions on the floor, and De Guiche, on his knees beside her, spreading
      out a handful of pearls and precious stones, while the princess, with her
      white and slender fingers pointed out such among them as pleased her the
      most. Again, in another corner of the room, a guitar player was playing
      some of the Spanish seguedillas, to which Madame had taken the greatest
      fancy ever since she had heard them sung by the young queen with a
      melancholy expression of voice. But the songs which the Spanish princess
      had sung with tears in her eyes, the young Englishwoman was humming with a
      smile that well displayed her beautiful teeth. The cabinet presented, in
      fact, the most perfect representation of unrestrained pleasure and
      amusement. As he entered, Monsieur was struck at beholding so many persons
      enjoying themselves without him. He was so jealous at the sight that he
      could not resist exclaiming, like a child, "What! you are amusing
      yourselves here, while I am sick and tired of being alone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of his voice was like a clap of thunder coming to interrupt the
      warbling of birds under the leafy covert of the trees; a dead silence
      ensued. De Guiche was on his feet in a moment. Malicorne tried to hide
      himself behind Montalais. Manicamp stood bolt upright, and assumed a very
      ceremonious demeanor. The guitar player thrust his instrument under a
      table, covering it with a piece of carpet to conceal it from the prince's
      observation. Madame was the only one who did not move, and smiling at her
      husband, said, "Is not this the hour you usually devote to your toilette?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An hour which others select, it seems, for amusing themselves," replied
      the prince, grumblingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This untoward remark was the signal for a general rout; the women fled
      like a flock of terrified starlings; the guitar player vanished like a
      shadow; Malicorne, still protected by Montalais, who purposely widened out
      her dress, glided behind the hanging tapestry. As for Manicamp, he went to
      the assistance of De Guiche, who naturally remained near Madame, and both
      of them, with the princess herself, courageously sustained the attack. The
      count was too happy to bear malice against the husband; but Monsieur bore
      a grudge against his wife. Nothing was wanting but a quarrel; he sought
      it, and the hurried departure of the crowd, which had been so joyous
      before he arrived, and was so disturbed by his entrance, furnished him
      with a pretext.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do they run away at the very sight of me?" he inquired, in a
      supercilious tone; to which remark Madame replied, that, "whenever the
      master of the house made his appearance, the family kept aloof out of
      respect." As she said this, she made so funny and so pretty a grimace,
      that De Guiche and Manicamp could not control themselves; they burst into
      a peal of laugher; Madame followed their example, and even Monsieur
      himself could not resist it, and he was obliged to sit down, as, for
      laughing, he could scarcely keep his equilibrium. However, he very soon
      left off, but his anger had increased. He was still more furious because
      he had permitted himself to laugh, than from having seen others laugh. He
      looked at Manicamp steadily, not venturing to show his anger towards De
      Guiche; but, at a sign which displayed no little amount of annoyance,
      Manicamp and De Guiche left the room, so that Madame, left alone, began
      sadly to pick up her pearls and amethysts, no longer smiling, and speaking
      still less.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very happy," said the duke, "to find myself treated as a stranger
      here, Madame," and he left the room in a passion. On his way out, he met
      Montalais, who was in attendance in the ante-room. "It is very agreeable
      to pay you a visit here, but outside the door."
    </p>
    <p>
      Montalais made a very low obeisance. "I do not quite understand what your
      royal highness does me the honor to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say that when you are all laughing together in Madame's apartment, he
      is an unwelcome visitor who does not remain outside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your royal highness does not think, and does not speak so, of yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, it is on my own account that I do speak and think. I
      have no reason, certainly, to flatter myself about the reception I meet
      with here at any time. How is it that, on the very day there is music and
      a little society in Madame's apartments&mdash;in my own apartments,
      indeed, for they are mine&mdash;on the very day that I wish to amuse
      myself a little in my turn, every one runs away? Are they afraid to see
      me, that they all take wing as soon as I appear? Is there anything wrong,
      then, going on in my absence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet nothing has been done to-day, monseigneur, which is not done every
      day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! do they laugh like that every day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The same group of people simpering and the same singing and strumming
      going on every day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The guitar, monseigneur, was introduced to-day; but when we have no
      guitars, we have violins and flutes; ladies soon weary without music."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The deuce!&mdash;and the men?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What men, monseigneur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Guiche, M. de Manicamp, and the rest of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They all belong to your highness's household."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, you are right," said the prince, as he returned to his own
      apartments, full of thought. He threw himself into the largest of his
      arm-chairs, without looking at himself in the glass. "Where can the
      chevalier be?" said he. One of the prince's attendants happened to be near
      him, overheard his remark, and replied,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one knows, your highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still the same answer. The first one who answers me again, 'I do not
      know,' I will discharge." Every one at this remark hurried out of his
      apartments, in the same manner as the others had fled from Madame's
      apartments. The prince then flew into the wildest rage. He kicked over a
      chiffonier, which tumbled on the carpet, broken into pieces. He next went
      into the galleries, and with the greatest coolness threw down, one after
      another, an enameled vase, a porphyry ewer, and a bronze candelabrum. The
      noise summoned every one to the various doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your highness's pleasure?" said the captain of the guards,
      timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am treating myself to some music," replied the prince, gnashing his
      teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the guards desired his royal highness's physician to be
      sent for. But before he came, Malicorne arrived, saying to the prince,
      "Monseigneur, the Chevalier de Lorraine is here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke looked at Malicorne, and smiled graciously at him, just as the
      chevalier entered.

      The Duc d'Orleans uttered a cry of delight on perceiving the Chevalier de
      Lorraine. "This is fortunate, indeed," he said; "by what happy chance do I
      see you? Had you indeed disappeared, as every one assured me?"

    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I felt that I was of no further use to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Explain yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness has people about you who are far more amusing that <i>I</i>
      can ever be. I felt I was not strong enough to enter into contest with
      them, and I therefore withdrew."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This extreme diffidence shows a want of common sense. Who are those with
      whom you cannot contend? De Guiche?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I name no one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is absurd. Does De Guiche annoy you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not say he does; do not force me to speak, however; you know very
      well that De Guiche is one of our best friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is it, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, monseigneur, let us say no more about it." The chevalier knew
      perfectly well that curiosity is excited in the same way as thirst &mdash;by
      removing that which quenches it; or in other words, by denying an
      explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said the prince; "I wish to know why you went away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, monseigneur, I will tell you; but do not get angry. I
      remarked that my presence was disagreeable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" said the duke in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is simple enough; Madame is very probably jealous of the regard you
      are good enough to testify for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has she shown it to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame never addresses a syllable to me, particularly since a certain
      time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since <i>what</i> time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since the time when, M. de Guiche having made himself more agreeable to
      her than I could, she receives him at every and any hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke colored. "At any hour, chevalier; what do you mean by that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, your highness, I have already displeased you; I was quite sure I
      should."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not displeased; but what you say is rather startling. In what
      respect does Madame prefer De Guiche to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall say no more," said the chevalier, saluting the prince
      ceremoniously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, I require you to speak. If you withdraw on that account,
      you must indeed be very jealous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One cannot help being jealous, monseigneur, when one loves. Is not your
      royal highness jealous of Madame? Would you not, if you saw some one
      always near Madame, and always treated with great favor, take umbrage at
      it? One's friends are as one's lovers. Your highness has sometimes
      conferred the distinguished honor upon me of calling me your friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes,; but you used a phrase which has a very equivocal significance;
      you are unfortunate in your phrases."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What phrase, monseigneur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You said, 'treated with great favor.' What do you mean by favor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing can be more simple," said the chevalier, with an expression of
      great frankness; "for instance, whenever a husband remarks that his wife
      summons such and such a man near her; whenever this man is always to be
      found by her side, or in attendance at the door of her carriage; whenever
      the bouquet of the one is always the same color as the ribbons of the
      other; when music and supper parties are held in private apartments;
      whenever a dead silence takes place immediately the husband makes his
      appearance in his wife's rooms; and when the husband suddenly finds that
      he has, as a companion, the most devoted and the kindest of men, who, a
      week before, was with him as little as possible; why, then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, finish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, I say, monseigneur, one possibly may get jealous. But all
      these details hardly apply; for our conversation had nothing to do with
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke was evidently very much agitated, and seemed to struggle with
      himself a good deal. "You have not told me," he then remarked, "why you
      absented yourself. A little while ago you said it was from a fear of
      intruding; you added, even, that you had observed a disposition on
      Madame's part to encourage De Guiche."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, monseigneur, I did not say that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did, indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if I did say so, I observed nothing but what was very inoffensive."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events, you remarked something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You embarrass me, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does that matter? Answer me. If you speak the truth, why should you
      feel embarrassed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always speak the truth, monseigneur; but I also always hesitate when it
      is a question of repeating what others say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! repeat? It appears that it is talked about, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I acknowledge that others have spoken to me on the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who?" said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chevalier assumed almost an angry air, as he replied, "Monseigneur,
      you are subjecting me to cross-examination; you treat me as a criminal at
      the bar; the rumors which idly pass by a gentleman's ears do not remain
      there. Your highness wishes me to magnify rumors until it attains the
      importance of an event."
    </p>
    <p>
      "However," said the duke, in great displeasure, "the fact remains that you
      withdrew on account of this report."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To speak the truth, others have talked to me of the attentions of M. de
      Guiche to Madame, nothing more; perfectly harmless, I repeat, and more
      than that, allowable. But do not be unjust, monseigneur, and do not attach
      any undue importance to it. It does not concern you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Guiche's attentions to Madame do not concern me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, monseigneur; and what I say to you I would say to De Guiche himself,
      so little do I think of the attentions he pays Madame. Nay, I would say it
      even to Madame herself. Only you understand what I am afraid of&mdash;I am
      afraid of being thought jealous of the favor shown, when I am only jealous
      as far as friendship is concerned. I know your disposition; I know that
      when you bestow your affections you become exclusively attached. You love
      Madame&mdash;and who, indeed, would <i>not</i> love her? Follow me
      attentively as I proceed:&mdash;Madame has noticed among your friends the
      handsomest and most fascinating of them all; she will begin to influence
      you on his behalf in such a way that you will neglect the others. Your
      indifference would kill me; it is already bad enough to have to support
      Madame's indifference. I have, therefore, made up my mind to give way to
      the favorite whose happiness I envy, even while I acknowledge my sincere
      friendship and sincere admiration for him. Well, monseigneur, do you see
      anything to object to in this reasoning? Is it not that of a man of honor?
      Is my conduct that of a sincere friend? Answer me, at least, after having
      so closely questioned me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke had seated himself, with his head buried in his hands. After a
      silence long enough to enable the chevalier to judge the effect of this
      oratorical display, the duke arose, saying, "Come, be candid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I always am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. You know that we already observed something respecting that
      mad fellow, Buckingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not say anything against Madame, monseigneur, or I shall take my
      leave. It is impossible you can be suspicious of Madame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, chevalier; I do not suspect Madame; but in fact, I observe&mdash;I
      compare&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Buckingham was a madman, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A madman about whom, however, you opened my eyes thoroughly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said the chevalier, quickly; "it was not I who opened your eyes,
      it was De Guiche. Do not confound us, I beg." And he began to laugh in so
      harsh a manner that it sounded like the hiss of a serpent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes; I remember. You said a few words, but De Guiche showed the most
      jealousy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think so," continued the chevalier, in the same tone. "He was
      fighting for home and altar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you say?" said the duke, haughtily, thoroughly roused by this
      insidious jest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I not right? for does not M. de Guiche hold the chief post of honor in
      your household?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," replied the duke, somewhat calmed, "had this passion of Buckingham
      been remarked?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. Do people say that M. de Guiche's is remarked as much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, monseigneur; you are again mistaken; no one says that M. de
      Guiche entertains anything of the sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, monseigneur, that it would have been better, a hundred times
      better, to have left me in my retirement, than to have allowed you to
      conjure up, by aid of any scruples I may have had, suspicions which Madame
      will regard as crimes, and she would be in the right, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Act reasonably."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should not pay the slightest attention to the society of these new
      Epicurean philosophers; and, in that way, the rumors will cease."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I will see; I will think it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you have time enough; the danger is not great; and then, besides, it
      is not a question of danger or of passion. It all arose from a fear I had
      to see your friendship for me decrease. From the very moment you restore
      it, with so kind an assurance of its existence, I have no longer any other
      idea in my head."
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke shook his head as if he meant to say: "If you have no more ideas,
      I have, though." It being now the dinner hour, the prince sent to inform
      Madame of it; but she returned a message to the effect that she could not
      be present, but would dine in her own apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not my fault," said the duke. "This morning, having taken them by
      surprise in the midst of a musical party, I got jealous; and so they are
      in the sulks with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will dine alone," said the chevalier, with a sigh; "I regret De Guiche
      is not here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! De Guiche will not remain long in the sulks; he is a very
      good-natured fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur," said the chevalier, suddenly, "an excellent idea has struck
      me, in our conversation just now. I may have exasperated your highness,
      and caused you some dissatisfaction. It is but fitting that I should be
      the mediator. I will go and look for the count, and bring him back with
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! chevalier, you are really a very good-natured fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say that as if you were surprised."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you are not so tender-hearted every day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may be; but confess that I know how to repair a wrong I may have
      done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I confess that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will your highness do me the favor to wait here a few minutes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Willingly; be off, and I will try on my Fontainebleau costume."
    </p>
    <p>
      The chevalier left the room, called his different attendant with the
      greatest care, as if he were giving them different orders. All went off in
      various directions; but he retained his <i>valet de chambre</i>.
      "Ascertain, and immediately, too, of M. de Guiche is not in Madame's
      apartments. How can one learn it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very easily, monsieur. I will ask Malicorne, who will find out from Mlle.
      de Montalais. I may as well tell you, however, that the inquiry will be
      useless; for all M. de Guiche's attendants are gone, and he must have left
      with them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ascertain, nevertheless."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes had hardly passed, when the valet returned. He beckoned his
      master mysteriously towards the servants' staircase, and showed him into a
      small room with a window looking out upon the garden. "What is the
      matter?" said the chevalier; "why so many precautions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look, monsieur," said the valet, "look yonder, under the walnut-tree."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah?" said the chevalier. "I see Manicamp there. What is he waiting for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will see in a moment, monsieur, if you wait patiently. There, do you
      see now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see one, two, four musicians with their instruments, and behind them,
      urging them on, De Guiche himself. What is he doing there, though?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is waiting until the little door of the staircase, belonging to the
      ladies of honor, is opened; by that staircase he will ascend to Madame's
      apartments, where some new pieces of music are going to be performed
      during dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is admirable news you tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not, monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it M. de Malicorne who told you this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He likes you, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, monsieur, it is Monsieur that he likes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because he wishes to belong to his household."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And most certainly he shall. How much did he give you for that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The secret which I now dispose of to you, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And which I buy for a hundred pistoles. Take them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, monsieur. Look, look, the little door opens; a woman admits
      the musicians."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Montalais."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, monseigneur; do not call out her name; whoever says Montalais says
      Malicorne. If you quarrel with the one, you will be on bad terms with the
      other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; I have seen nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I," said the valet, pocketing the purse, "have received nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      The chevalier, being now certain that Guiche had entered, returned to the
      prince, whom he found splendidly dressed and radiant with joy, as with
      good looks. "I am told," he exclaimed, "that the king has taken the sun as
      his device; really, monseigneur, it is you whom this device would best
      suit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is De Guiche?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He cannot be found. He has fled&mdash;has evaporated entirely. Your
      scolding of this morning terrified him. He could not be found in his
      apartments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah! the hair-brained fellow is capable of setting off post-haste to his
      own estates. Poor man! we will recall him. Come, let us dine now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur, to-day is a very festival of ideas; I have another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame is angry with you, and she has reason to be so. You owe her
      revenge; go and dine with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! that would be acting like a weak and whimsical husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the duty of a good husband to do so. The princess is no doubt
      wearied enough; she will be weeping in her plate, and here eyes will get
      quite red. A husband who is the cause of his wife's eyes getting red is an
      odious creature. Come, monseigneur, come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot; for I have directed dinner to be served here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet see, monseigneur, how dull we shall be; I shall be low-spirited
      because I know that Madame will be alone; you, hard and savage as you wish
      to appear, will be sighing all the while. Take me with you to Madame's
      dinner, and that will be a delightful surprise. I am sure we shall be very
      merry; you were in the wrong this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, perhaps I was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no perhaps at all, for it is a fact you were so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chevalier, chevalier, your advice is not good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, my advice is good; all the advantages are on your own side. Your
      violet-colored suit, embroidered with gold, becomes you admirably. Madame
      will be as much vanquished by the man as by the action. Come,
      monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You decide me; let us go."
    </p>
    <p>
      The duke left his room, accompanied by the chevalier and went towards
      Madame's apartments. The chevalier hastily whispered to the valet, "Be
      sure there are some people before that little door, so that no one can
      escape in that direction. Run, run!" And he followed the duke towards the
      ante-chambers of Madame's suite of apartments, and when the ushers were
      about to announce them, the chevalier said, laughing, "His highness wishes
      to surprise Madame."

      Chapter XXXII. Monsieur is Jealous of Guiche.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Monsieur entered the room abruptly, as persons do who mean well and think
      they confer pleasure, or as those who hope to surprise some secret, the
      terrible reward of jealous people. Madame, almost out of her senses with
      joy at the first bars of music, was dancing in the most unrestrained
      manner, leaving the dinner, which had been already begun, unfinished. Her
      partner was M. de Guiche, who, with his arms raised, and his eyes half
      closed, was kneeling on one knee, like the Spanish dancers, with looks
      full of passion, and gestures of the most caressing character. The
      princess was dancing round him with a responsive smile, and the same air
      of alluring seductiveness. Montalais stood by admiringly; La Valliere,
      seated in a corner of the room, looked on thoughtfully. It is impossible
      to describe the effect which the presence of the prince produced upon this
      gleeful company, and it would be equally impossible to describe the effect
      which the sight of their happiness produced upon Philip. The Comte de
      Guiche had no power to move; Madame remained in the middle of one of the
      figures and of an attitude, unable to utter a word. The Chevalier de
      Lorraine, leaning his back against the doorway, smiled like a man in the
      very height of the frankest admiration. The pallor of the prince, and the
      convulsive twitching of his hands and limbs, were the first symptoms that
      struck those present. A dead silence succeeded the merry music of the
      dance. The Chevalier de Lorraine took advantage of this interval to salute
      Madame and De Guiche most respectfully, affecting to join them together in
      his reverences as though they were the master and mistress of the house.
      Monsieur then approached them, saying, in a hoarse tone of voice, "I am
      delighted; I came here expecting to find you ill and low-spirited, and I
      find you abandoning yourself to new amusements; really, it is most
      fortunate. My house is the pleasantest in the kingdom." Then turning
      towards De Guiche, "Comte," he said, "I did not know you were so good a
      dancer." And, again addressing his wife, he said, "Show a little more
      consideration for me, Madame; whenever you intend to amuse yourselves
      here, invite me. I am a prince, unfortunately, very much neglected."
    </p>
    <p>
      Guiche had now recovered his self-possession, and with the spirited
      boldness which was natural to him, and sat so well upon him, he said,
      "Your highness knows very well that my very life is at your service, and
      whenever there is a question of its being needed, I am ready; but to-day,
      as it is only a question of dancing to music, I dance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are perfectly right," said the prince, coldly. "But, Madame," he
      continued, "you do not remark that your ladies deprive me of my friends;
      M. de Guiche does not belong to you, Madame, but to me. If you wish to
      dine without me you have your ladies. When I dine alone I have my
      gentlemen; do not strip me of <i>everything</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame felt the reproach and the lesson, and the color rushed to her face.
      "Monsieur," she replied, "I was not aware, when I came to the court of
      France, that princesses of my rank were to be regarded as the women in
      Turkey are. I was not aware that we were not allowed to be seen; but,
      since such is your desire, I will conform myself to it; pray do not
      hesitate, if you should wish it, to have my windows barred, even."
    </p>
    <p>
      This repartee, which made Montalais and De Guiche smile, rekindled the
      prince's anger, no inconsiderable portion of which had already evaporated
      in words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," he said, in a concentrated tone of voice, "this is the way in
      which I am respected in my own house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur, monseigneur," murmured the chevalier in the duke's ear, in
      such a manner that every one could observe he was endeavoring to calm him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come," replied the prince, as his only answer to the remark, hurrying him
      away, and turning round with so hasty a movement that he almost ran
      against Madame. The chevalier followed him to his own apartment, where the
      prince had no sooner seated himself than he gave free vent to his fury.
      The chevalier raised his eyes towards the ceiling, joined his hands
      together, and said not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me your opinion," exclaimed the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon what is taking place here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, monseigneur, it is a very serious matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is abominable! I cannot live in this manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How miserable all this is," said the chevalier. "We hoped to enjoy
      tranquillity after that madman Buckingham had left."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this is worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not say that, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but I say it; for Buckingham would never have ventured upon a fourth
      part of what we have just now seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To conceal oneself for the purposes of dancing, and to feign
      indisposition in order to dine <i>tete-a-tete</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," exclaimed the prince, exciting himself like a self-willed
      child; "but I will not endure it any longer, I must learn what is really
      going on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, monseigneur, an exposure&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heaven, monsieur, <i>shall</i> I put myself out of the way, when
      people show so little consideration for me? Wait for me here, chevalier,
      wait for me here." The prince disappeared in the neighboring apartment and
      inquired of the gentleman in attendance if the queen-mother had returned
      from chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Austria felt that her happiness was now complete; peace restored
      to her family, a nation delighted with the presence of a young monarch who
      had shown an aptitude for affairs of great importance; the revenues of the
      state increased; external peace assured; everything seemed to promise a
      tranquil future. Her thoughts recurred, now and then, to the poor young
      nobleman whom she had received as a mother, and had driven away as a
      hard-hearted step-mother, and she sighed as she thought of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the Duc d'Orleans entered her room. "Dear mother," he exclaimed
      hurriedly, closing the door, "things cannot go on as they are now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Austria raised her beautiful eyes towards him, and with an unmoved
      suavity of manner, said, "What do you allude to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to speak of Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose that silly fellow Buckingham has been writing a farewell letter
      to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! yes, madame; of course, it is a question of Buckingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of whom else could it be, then? for that poor fellow was, wrongly enough,
      the object of your jealousy, and I thought&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wife, madame, has already replaced the Duke of Buckingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Philip, what are you saying? You are speaking very heedlessly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no. Madame has so managed matters, that I am still jealous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of whom, in Heaven's name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible you have not remarked it? Have you not noticed that M. de
      Guiche is always in her apartments&mdash;always with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen clapped her hands together, and began to laugh. "Philip," she
      said, "your jealousy is not merely a defect, it is a disease."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whether a defect or a disease, madame, I am the sufferer from it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you imagine that a complaint which exists only in your own
      imagination can be cured? You wish it to be said you are right in being
      jealous, when there is no ground whatever for your jealousy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, you will begin to say for this gentleman what you already said
      on the behalf of the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, Philip," said the queen dryly, "what you did for the other, you
      are going to do for this one."
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince bowed, slightly annoyed. "If I give you facts," he said, "will
      you believe me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it regarded anything else but jealousy, I would believe you without
      your bringing facts forward; but as jealousy is the case, I promise
      nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is just the same as if your majesty were to desire me to hold my
      tongue, and sent me away unheard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Far from it; you are my son, I owe you a mother's indulgence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, say what you think; you owe me as much indulgence as a madman
      deserves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not exaggerate, Philip, and take care how you represent your wife to
      me as a woman of depraved mind&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But facts, mother, facts!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I am listening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This morning at ten o'clock they were playing music in Madame's
      apartments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No harm in that, surely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Guiche was talking with her alone&mdash;Ah! I forgot to tell you,
      that, during the last ten days, he has never left her side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If they were doing any harm they would hide themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good," exclaimed the duke, "I expected you to say that. Pray
      remember with precision the words you have just uttered. This morning I
      took them by surprise, and showed my dissatisfaction in a very marked
      manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rely upon it, that is quite sufficient; it was, perhaps, even a little
      too much. These young women easily take offense. To reproach them for an
      error they have not committed is, sometimes, almost equivalent to telling
      them they might be guilty of even worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, very good; but wait a minute. Do not forget what you have just
      this moment said, that this morning's lesson ought to have been
      sufficient, and that if they had been doing what was wrong, they would
      have hidden themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I said so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, just now, repenting of my hastiness of the morning, and imagining
      that Guiche was sulking in his own apartments, I went to pay Madame a
      visit. Can you guess what, or whom, I found there? Another set of
      musicians; more dancing, and Guiche himself&mdash;he was concealed there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Austria frowned. "It was imprudent," she said. "What did Madame
      say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Guiche?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As much&mdash;oh, no! he muttered some impertinent remark or another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what is your opinion, Philip?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I have been made a fool of; that Buckingham was only a pretext, and
      that Guiche is the one who is really to blame in the matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne shrugged her shoulders. "Well," she said, "what else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish De Guiche to be dismissed from my household, as Buckingham was,
      and I shall ask the king, unless&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless you, my dear mother, who are so clever and so kind, will execute
      the commission yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not do it, Philip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, madame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, Philip; I am not disposed to pay people ill compliments every
      day; I have some influence over young people, but I cannot take advantage
      of it without running the chances of losing it altogether. Besides, there
      is nothing to prove that M. de Guiche is guilty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has displeased me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is your own affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, I know what I shall do," said the prince, impetuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne looked at him with some uneasiness. "What do you intend to do?" she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will have him drowned in my fish-pond the very next time I find him in
      my apartments again." Having launched this terrible threat, the prince
      expected his mother would be frightened out of her senses; but the queen
      was unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was as weak as a woman, and began to cry out, "Every one betrays
      me,&mdash;no one cares for me; my mother, even, joins my enemies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your mother, Philip, sees further in the matter than you do, and does not
      care about advising you, since you will not listen to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go to the king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was about to propose that to you. I am now expecting his majesty; it is
      the hour he usually pays me a visit; explain the matter to him yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had hardly finished when Philip heard the door of the ante-room open
      with some noise. He began to feel nervous. At the sound of the king's
      footsteps, which could be heard upon the carpet, the duke hurriedly made
      his escape. Anne of Austria could not resist laughing, and was laughing
      still when the king entered. He came very affectionately to inquire after
      the even now uncertain health of the queen-mother, and to announce to her
      that the preparations for the journey to Fontainebleau were complete.
      Seeing her laugh, his uneasiness on her account diminished, and he
      addressed her in a vivacious tone himself. Anne of Austria took him by the
      hand, and, in a voice full of playfulness, said, "Do you know, sire that I
      am proud of being a Spanish woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, madame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because Spanish women are worth more than English women at least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Explain yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since your marriage you have not, I believe, had a single reproach to
      make against the queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you, too, have been married some time. Your brother, on the contrary,
      has been married but a fortnight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is now finding fault with Madame a second time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, Buckingham still?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Guiche."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really? Madame is a coquette, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fear so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My poor brother," said the king, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't object to coquettes, it seems?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Madame, certainly I do; but Madame is not a coquette at heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may be, but your brother is excessively angry about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does he want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wants to drown Guiche."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a violent measure to resort to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not laugh; he is extremely irritated. Think of what can be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To save Guiche&mdash;certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of, if your brother heard you, he would conspire against you as your
      uncle did against your father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; Philip has too much affection for me for that, and I, on my side,
      have too great a regard for him; we shall live together on very good
      terms. But what is the substance of his request?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you will prevent Madame from being a coquette and Guiche from being
      amiable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that all? My brother has an exalted idea of sovereign power. To reform
      a man, not to speak about reforming a woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How will you set about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With a word to Guiche, who is a clever fellow, I will undertake to
      convince him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Madame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is more difficult; a word will not be enough. I will compose a
      homily and read it to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no time to be lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I will use the utmost diligence. There is a repetition of the ballet
      this afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will read her a lecture while you are dancing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You promise to convert her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will root out the heresy altogether, either by convincing her, or by
      extreme measures."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is all right, then. Do not mix me up in the affair; Madame would
      never forgive me all her life, and as a mother-in-law, I ought to desire
      to live on good terms with my new-found daughter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king, madame, will take all upon himself. But let me reflect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be better, perhaps, if I were to go and see Madame in her own
      apartment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would that not seem a somewhat serious step to take?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but seriousness is not unbecoming in preachers, and the music of the
      ballet would drown half my arguments. Besides, the object is to prevent
      any violent measures on my brother's part, so that a little precipitation
      may be advisable. Is Madame in her own apartment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is my statement of grievances to consist of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a few words, of the following: music uninterruptedly; Guiche's
      assiduity; suspicions of treasonable plots and practices."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the proofs?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There <i>are</i> none."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; I will go at once to see Madame." The king turned to look in
      the mirrors at his costume, which was very rich, and his face, which was
      radiant as the morning. "I suppose my brother is kept a little at a
      distance," said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fire and water cannot be more opposite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will do. Permit me, madame, to kiss your hands, the most beautiful
      hands in France."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May you be successful, sire, as the family peacemaker."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not employ an ambassador," said Louis, "which is as much as to say
      that I shall succeed." He laughed as he left the room, and carelessly
      adjusted his ruffles as he went along.

      Chapter XXXIII. The Mediator.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the king made his appearance in Madame's apartments, the courtiers,
      whom the news of a conjugal misunderstanding had dispersed through the
      various apartments, began to entertain the most serious apprehensions. A
      storm was brewing in that direction, the elements of which the Chevalier
      de Lorraine, in the midst of the different groups, was analyzing with
      delight, contributing to the weaker, and acting, according to his own
      wicked designs, in such a manner with regard to the stronger, as to
      produce the most disastrous consequences possible. As Anne of Austria had
      herself said, the presence of the king gave a solemn and serious character
      to the event. Indeed, in the year 1662, the dissatisfaction of Monsieur
      with Madame, and the king's intervention in the private affairs of
      Monsieur, was a matter of no inconsiderable moment. <a href="#linknote-3"
      name="linknoteref-3" id="linknoteref-3"><small>3</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The boldest, even, who had been the associates of the Comte de Guiche,
      had, from the first moment, held aloof from him, with a sort of nervous
      apprehension; and the comte himself, infected by the general panic,
      retired to his own room. The king entered Madame's private apartments,
      acknowledging and returning the salutations, as he was always in the habit
      of doing. The ladies of honor were ranged in a line on his passage along
      the gallery. Although his majesty was very much preoccupied, he gave the
      glance of a master at the two rows of young and beautiful girls, who
      modestly cast down their eyes, blushing as they felt the king's gaze fall
      upon them. One only of the number, whose long hair fell in silken masses
      upon the most beautiful skin imaginable, was pale, and could hardly
      sustain herself, notwithstanding the knocks which her companion gave her
      with her elbow. It was La Valliere whom Montalais supported in that manner
      by whispering some of that courage to her with which she herself was so
      abundantly provided. The king could not resist turning round to look at
      them again. Their faces, which had already been raised, were again
      lowered, but the only fair head among them remained motionless, as if all
      the strength and intelligence she had left had abandoned her. When he
      entered Madame's room, Louis found his sister-in-law reclining upon the
      cushions of her cabinet. She rose and made a profound reverence, murmuring
      some words of thanks for the honor she was receiving. She then resumed her
      seat, overcome by a sudden weakness, which was no doubt assumed, for a
      delightful color animated her cheeks, and her eyes, still red from the
      tears she had recently shed, never had more fire in them. When the king
      was seated, as soon as he had remarked, with that accuracy of observation
      which characterized him, the disorder of the apartment, and the no less
      great disorder of Madame's countenance, he assumed a playful manner,
      saying, "My dear sister, at what hour to-day would you wish the repetition
      of the ballet to take place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame, shaking her charming head, slowly and languishingly said: "Ah!
      sire, will you graciously excuse my appearance at the repetition? I was
      about to send to inform you that I could not attend to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed," said the king, in apparent surprise; "are you not well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will summon your medical attendants, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, for they can do nothing for my indisposition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You alarm me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, I wish to ask your majesty's permission to return to England."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king started. "Return to England," he said; "do you really say what
      you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say it reluctantly, sire," replied the grand-daughter of Henry IV.,
      firmly, her beautiful black eyes flashing. "I regret to have to confide
      such matters to your majesty, but I feel myself too unhappy at your
      majesty's court; and I wish to return to my own family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, madame," exclaimed the king, as he approached her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me, sire," continued the young woman, acquiring by degrees that
      ascendency over her interrogator which her beauty and her nervous nature
      conferred; "young as I am, I have already suffered humiliation, and have
      endured disdain here. Oh! do not contradict me, sire," she said, with a
      smile. The king colored.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," she continued, "I had reasoned myself into the belief that Heaven
      called me into existence with that object&mdash;I, the daughter of a
      powerful monarch; that since my father had been deprived of life, Heaven
      could well smite my pride. I have suffered greatly; I have been the cause,
      too, of my mother suffering much; but I vowed that if Providence ever
      placed me in a position of independence, even were it that of a workman of
      the lower classes, who gains her bread by her labor, I would never suffer
      humiliation again. That day has now arrived; I have been restored to the
      fortune due to my rank and to my birth; I have even ascended again the
      steps of a throne, and I thought that, in allying myself with a French
      prince, I should find in him a relation, a friend, an equal; but I
      perceive I have found only a master, and I rebel. My mother shall know
      nothing of it; you whom I respect, and whom I&mdash;love&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The king started; never had any voice so gratified his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, sire, who know all, since you have come here; you will, perhaps,
      understand me. If you had not come, I should have gone to you. I wish for
      permission to go away. I leave it to your delicacy of feeling to exculpate
      and to protect me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sister," murmured the king, overpowered by this bold attack,
      "have you reflected upon the enormous difficulty of the project you have
      conceived?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, I do not reflect, I feel. Attacked, I instinctively repel the
      attack, nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, tell me, what have they done to you?" said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess, it will have been seen, by this peculiarly feminine
      maneuver, had escaped every reproach, and advanced on her side a far more
      serious one; from the accused she became the accuser. It is an infallible
      sign of guilt; but notwithstanding that, all women, even the least clever
      of the sex, invariably know how to derive some such means of turning the
      tables. The king had forgotten that he was paying her a visit in order to
      say to her, "What have you done to my brother?" and he was reduced to
      weakly asking her, "What have they done to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have they done to me?" replied Madame. "One must be a woman to
      understand it, sire&mdash;they have made me shed tears;" and, with one of
      her fingers, whose slenderness and perfect whiteness were unequaled, she
      pointed to her brilliant eyes swimming with unshed drops, and again began
      to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I implore you, my dear sister!" said the king, advancing to take her warm
      and throbbing hand, which she abandoned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place, sire, I was deprived of the presence of my brother's
      friend. The Duke of Buckingham was an agreeable, cheerful visitor; my own
      countryman, who knew my habits; I will say almost a companion, so
      accustomed had we been to pass our days together, with our other friends,
      upon the beautiful piece of water at St. James's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Villiers was in love with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pretext! What does it matter," she said, seriously, "whether the duke
      was in love with me or not? Is a man in love so very dangerous for me? Ah!
      sire, it is not sufficient for a man to love a woman." And she smiled so
      tenderly, and with so much archness, that the king felt his heart swell
      and throb in his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events, if my brother were jealous?" interrupted the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, I admit that is a reason; and the duke was sent away
      accordingly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not sent away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Driven away, dismissed, expelled, then, if you prefer it, sire. One of
      the first gentlemen of Europe obliged to leave the court of the King of
      France, of Louis XIV., like a beggar, on account of a glance or a bouquet.
      It was little worthy of a most gallant court; but forgive me, sire; I
      forgot, that, in speaking thus, I am attacking your sovereign power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I assure you, my dear sister, it was not I who dismissed the Duke of
      Buckingham; I was charmed with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not you?" said Madame; "ah! so much the better;" and she
      emphasized the "so much the better," as if she had instead said, "so much
      the worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes' silence ensued. She then resumed: "The Duke of Buckingham
      having left&mdash;I now know why and by whose means&mdash;I thought I
      should have recovered my tranquillity; but not at all, for all at once
      Monsieur found another pretext; all at once&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All at once," said the king, playfully, "some one else presents himself.
      It is but natural; you are beautiful, and will always meet with men who
      will madly love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case," exclaimed the princess, "I will create a solitude around
      me, which indeed seems to be what is wished, and what is being prepared
      for me. But no, I prefer to return to London. There I am known and
      appreciated. I shall have friends, without fearing they may be regarded as
      my lovers. Shame! it is a disgraceful suspicion, and unworthy a gentleman.
      Monsieur has lost everything in my estimation, since he has shown me he
      can be a tyrant to a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay, my brother's only fault is that of loving you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love me! Monsieur love me! Ah! sire," and she burst out laughing.
      "Monsieur will never love any woman," she said; "Monsieur loves himself
      too much; no, unhappily for me, Monsieur's jealousy is of the worst kind&mdash;he
      is jealous without love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confess, however," said the king, who began to be excited by this varied
      and animated conversation; "confess that Guiche loves you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! sire, I know nothing about that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must have perceived it. A man who loves readily betrays himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Guiche has not betrayed himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sister, you are defending M. de Guiche."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, indeed! Ah, sire, I only needed a suspicion from yourself to crown my
      wretchedness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, madame, no," returned the king, hurriedly; "do not distress yourself.
      Nay, you are weeping. I implore you to calm yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      She wept, however, and large tears fell upon her hands; the king took one
      of her hands in his, and kissed the tears away. She looked at him so sadly
      and with so much tenderness that he felt his heart giving way under her
      gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have no kind of feeling, then, for Guiche?" he said, more disturbed
      than became his character of mediator.
    </p>
    <p>
      "None&mdash;absolutely none."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I can reassure my brother in that respect?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing will satisfy him, sire. Do not believe he is jealous. Monsieur
      has been badly advised by some one, and he is of nervous disposition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He may well be so when you are concerned," said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame cast down her eyes, and was silent; the king did so likewise, still
      holding her hand all the while. Their momentary silence seemed to last an
      age. Madame gently withdrew her hand, and from that moment, she felt her
      triumph was certain, and that the field of battle was her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur complains," said the king, "that you prefer the society of
      private individuals to his own conversation and society."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Monsieur passes his life in looking at his face in the glass, and in
      plotting all sorts of spiteful things against women with the Chevalier de
      Lorraine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you are going somewhat too far."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I only tell you what is true. Do you observe for yourself, sire, and you
      will see that I am right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will observe; but, in the meantime, what satisfaction can I give my
      brother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My departure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You repeat that word," exclaimed the king, imprudently, as if, during the
      last ten minutes, such a change had been produced that Madame would have
      had all her ideas on the subject thoroughly changed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, I cannot be happy here any longer," she said. "M. de Guiche annoys
      Monsieur. Will he be sent away, too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it be necessary, why not?" replied the king, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well; and after M. de Guiche&mdash;whom, by the by, I shall regret&mdash;I
      warn you, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you will regret him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly; he is amiable, he has a great friendship for me, and he amuses
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Monsieur were only to hear you," said the king, slightly annoyed, "do
      you know I would not undertake to make it up again between you; nay, I
      would not even attempt it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, can you, even now, prevent Monsieur from being jealous of the first
      person who may approach? I know very well that M. de Guiche is not the
      first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Again I warn you that as a good brother I shall take a dislike to De
      Guiche."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, sire, do not, I entreat you, adopt either the sympathies or the
      dislikes of Monsieur. Remain king; better for yourself and for every one
      else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You jest charmingly, madame; and I can well understand how the people you
      attack must adore you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is that the reason why you, sire, whom I had regarded as my defender,
      are about to join these who persecute me?" said Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I your persecutor! Heaven forbid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," she continued, languishingly, "grant me a favor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever you wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me return to England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, never!" exclaimed Louis XIV.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a prisoner, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In France&mdash;if France is a prison&mdash;yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What must I do, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you. Instead of devoting yourself to friendships which are
      somewhat unstable, instead of alarming us by your retirement, remain
      always in our society, do not leave us, let us live as a united family. M.
      de Guiche is certainly very amiable; but if, at least, we do not possess
      his wit&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, sire, you know very well you are pretending to be modest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I swear to you. One may be a king, and yet feel that he possesses
      fewer chances of pleasing than many other gentlemen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure, sire, that you do not believe a single word you are saying."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king looked at Madame tenderly, and said, "Will you promise me one
      thing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you will no longer waste upon strangers, in your own apartments, the
      time which you owe us. Shall we make an offensive and defensive alliance
      against the common enemy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "An alliance with you, sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? Are you not a sovereign power?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But are you, sire, a reliable ally?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall see, madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when shall this alliance commence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This very day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will draw up the treaty, and you shall sign it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blindly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, sire, I promise you wonders; you are the star of the court, and
      when you make your appearance, everything will be resplendent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, madame, madame," said Louis XIV., "you know well that there is no
      brilliancy that does not proceed from yourself, and that if I assume the
      sun as my device, it is only an emblem."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, you flatter your ally, and you wish to deceive her," said Madame,
      threatening the king with her finger menacingly raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! you believe I am deceiving you, when I assure you of my affection?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What makes you so suspicious?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it? I shall indeed be unhappy if I do not overcome it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That one thing in question, sire, is not in your power, not even in the
      power of Heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me what it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The past."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not understand, madame," said the king, precisely because he had
      understood her but too well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess took his hand in hers. "Sire," she said, "I have had the
      misfortune to displease you for so long a period, that I have almost the
      right to ask myself to-day why you were able to accept me as a
      sister-in-law."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Displease me! You have displeased me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, do not deny it, for I remember it well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our alliance shall date from to-day," exclaimed the king, with a warmth
      that was not assumed. "You will not think any more of the past, will you?
      I myself am resolved that I will not. I shall always remember the present;
      I have it before my eyes; look." And he led the princess before a mirror,
      in which she saw herself reflected, blushing and beautiful enough to
      overcome a saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is all the same," she murmured; "it will not be a very worthy
      alliance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must I swear?" inquired the king, intoxicated by the voluptuous turn the
      whole conversation had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I will not refuse to witness a resounding oath," said Madame; "it has
      always the <i>semblance</i> of security."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king knelt upon a footstool and took Madame's hand. She, with a smile
      that no painter could ever succeed in depicting, and which a poet might
      only imagine, gave him both her hands, in which he hid his burning face.
      Neither of them could utter a syllable. The king felt Madame withdraw her
      hands, caressing his face while she did so. He rose immediately and left
      the apartment. The courtiers remarked his heightened color, and concluded
      that the scene had been a stormy one. The Chevalier de Lorraine, however,
      hastened to say, "Nay, be comforted, gentlemen, his majesty is always pale
      when he is angry."

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXIV. The Advisers.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king left Madame in a state of agitation it would have been difficult
      even for himself to have explained. It is impossible, in fact, to depict
      the secret play of those strange sympathies which, suddenly and apparently
      without any cause, are excited, after many years passed in the greatest
      calmness and indifference, by two hearts destined to love each other. Why
      had Louis formerly disdained, almost hated, Madame? Why did he now find
      the same woman so beautiful, so captivating? And why, not only were his
      thoughts occupied about her, but still more, why were they so continuously
      occupied about her? Why, in fact, had Madame, whose eyes and mind were
      sought for in another direction, shown during the last week towards the
      king a semblance of favor which encouraged the belief of still greater
      regard. It must not be supposed that Louis proposed to himself any plan of
      seduction; the tie which united Madame to his brother was, or at least,
      seemed to him, an insuperable barrier; he was even too far removed from
      that barrier to perceive its existence. But on the downward path of those
      passions in which the heart rejoices, towards which youth impels us, no
      one can decide where to stop, not even the man who has in advance
      calculated all the chances of his own success or another's submission. As
      far as Madame was concerned, her regard for the king may easily be
      explained: she was young, a coquette, and ardently fond of admiration.
      Hers was one of those buoyant, impetuous natures, which upon a theatre
      would leap over the greatest obstacles to obtain an acknowledgement of
      applause from the spectators. It was not surprising, then, that, after
      having been adored by Buckingham, by De Guiche, who was superior to
      Buckingham, even if it were only from that negative merit, so much
      appreciated by women, that is to say, novelty&mdash;it was not surprising,
      we say, that the princess should raise her ambition to being admired by
      the king, who not only was the first person in the kingdom, but was one of
      the handsomest and cleverest men in Europe. As for the sudden passion with
      which Louis was inspired for his sister-in-law, physiology would perhaps
      supply an explanation by some hackneyed commonplace reasons, and nature by
      means of her mysterious affinity of characters. Madame had the most
      beautiful black eyes in the world; Louis, eyes as beautiful, but blue.
      Madame was laughter-loving and unreserved in her manners; Louis,
      melancholy and diffident. Summoned to meet each other for the first time
      upon the grounds of interest and common curiosity, these two opposite
      natures were mutually influenced by the mingling of their reciprocal
      contradictions of character. Louis, when he returned to his own rooms,
      acknowledged to himself that Madame was the most attractive woman of his
      court. Madame, left alone, delightedly thought that she had made a great
      impression on the king. This feeling with her must remain passive, whilst
      the king could not but act with all the natural vehemence of the heated
      fancies of a young man, and of a young man who has but to express a wish
      to see his wish fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing the king did was to announce to Monsieur that everything
      was quietly arranged; that Madame had the greatest respect, the sincerest
      affection for him; but that she was of a proud, impetuous character, and
      that her susceptibilities were so acute as to require very careful
      management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur replied in the reticent tone of voice he generally adopted with
      his brother, that he could not very well understand the susceptibilities
      of a woman whose conduct might, in his opinion, expose her to censorious
      remarks, and that if any one had a right to feel wounded, it was he,
      Monsieur himself. To this the king replied in a quick tone of voice, which
      showed the interest he took in his sister-in-law, "Thank Heaven, Madame is
      above censure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The censure of others, certainly, I admit," said Monsieur; "but not above
      mine, I presume."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the king, "all I have to say, Philip, is that Madame's
      conduct does not deserve your censure. She certainly is heedless and
      singular, but professes the best feelings. The English character is not
      always well understood in France, and the liberty of English manners
      sometimes surprises those who do not know the extent to which this liberty
      is enriched by innocence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Monsieur, more and more piqued, "from the very moment that your
      majesty absolves my wife, whom I accuse, my wife is not guilty, and I have
      nothing more to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Philip," replied the king hastily, for he felt the voice of conscience
      murmuring softly in his heart, that Monsieur was not altogether wrong,
      "what I have done, and what I have said, has been only for your happiness.
      I was told that you complained of a want of confidence and attention on
      Madame's part, and I did not wish your uneasiness to be prolonged. It is
      part of my duty to watch over your household, as over that of the humblest
      of my subjects. I have satisfied myself, therefore, with the sincerest
      pleasure, that your apprehensions have no foundation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And," continued Monsieur, in an interrogative tone of voice, and fixing
      his eyes upon his brother, "what your majesty has discovered for Madame
      &mdash;and I bow myself to your superior judgment&mdash;have you verified
      for those who have been the cause of the scandal of which I complain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, Philip," said the king; "I will reserve that point for
      future consideration."
    </p>
    <p>
      These words comprised an order as well as a consolation; the prince felt
      it to be so, and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Louis, he went to seek his mother, for he felt that he had need of
      a more complete absolution than that he had just received from his
      brother. Anne of Austria did not entertain for M. de Guiche the same
      reasons for indulgence she had had for Buckingham. She perceived, at the
      very first words he pronounced, that Louis was not disposed to be severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      To appear in a contradictory humor was one of the stratagems of the good
      queen, in order to succeed in ascertaining the truth. But Louis was no
      longer in his apprenticeship; already for more than a year past he had
      been king, and during that year he had learned how to dissemble. Listening
      to Anne of Austria, in order to permit her to disclose her own thoughts,
      testifying his approval only by look and gesture, he became convinced,
      from certain piercing glances, and from certain skillful insinuations,
      that the queen, so clear-sighted in matters of gallantry, had, if not
      guessed, at least suspected, his weakness for Madame. Of all his
      auxiliaries, Anne of Austria would be the most important to secure; of all
      his enemies, Anne of Austria would prove most dangerous. Louis, therefore,
      changed his maneuvers. He complained of Madame, absolved Monsieur,
      listened to what his mother had to say of De Guiche, as he had previously
      listened to what she had to say of Buckingham, and then, when he saw that
      she thought she had gained a complete victory over him, he left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of the court, that is to say, all the favorites and more
      intimate associates, and they were numerous, since there were already five
      masters, were assembled in the evening for the repetition of the ballet.
      This interval had been occupied by poor De Guiche in receiving visits;
      among the number was one which he hoped and feared nearly to an equal
      extent. It was that of the Chevalier de Lorraine. About three o'clock in
      the afternoon the chevalier entered De Guiche's rooms. His looks were of
      the most reassuring character. "Monsieur," said he to De Guiche, "was in
      an excellent humor, and no none could say that the slightest cloud had
      passed across the conjugal sky. Besides, Monsieur was not one to bear
      ill-feeling."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time past, during his residence at the court, the Chevalier de
      Lorraine had decided, that of Louis XIII.'s two sons, Monsieur was the one
      who had inherited the father's character&mdash;an uncertain, irresolute
      character; impulsively good, indifferently disposed at bottom; but
      certainly a cipher for his friends. He especially cheered De Guiche, by
      pointing out to him that Madame would, before long, succeed in governing
      her husband, and that, consequently, that man would govern Monsieur who
      should succeed in influencing Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this, De Guiche full of mistrust and presence of mind, replied, "Yes,
      chevalier; but I believe Madame to be a very dangerous person."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what respect?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has perceived that Monsieur is not very passionately inclined towards
      women."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true," said the Chevalier de Lorraine, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, Madame will choose the first one who approaches, in order
      to make him the object of her preference, and to bring back her husband by
      jealousy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deep! deep!" exclaimed the chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But true," replied De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither the one nor the other expressed his real thought. De Guiche, at
      the very moment he thus attacked Madame's character, mentally asked her
      forgiveness from the bottom of his heart. The chevalier, while admiring De
      Guiche's penetration, was leading him, blindfolded, to the brink of the
      precipice. De Guiche then questioned him more directly upon the effect
      produced by the scene of the morning, and upon the still more serious
      effect produced by the scene at dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I have already told you they are all laughing at it," replied the
      Chevalier de Lorraine, "and Monsieur himself at the head of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet," hazarded De Guiche, "I have heard that the king paid Madame a
      visit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, precisely so. Madame was the only one who did not laugh, and the
      king went to her in order to make her laugh, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that nothing is altered in the arrangements of the day," said the
      chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is there a repetition of the ballet this evening?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite," returned the chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment of the conversation between the two young men, Raoul
      entered, looking full of anxiety. As soon as the chevalier, who had a
      secret dislike for him, as for every other noble character, perceived him
      enter, he rose from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you advise me to do, then?" inquired De Guiche of the chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I advise you to go to sleep in perfect tranquillity, my dear count."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And my advice, De Guiche," said Raoul, "is the very opposite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To mount your horse and set off at once for one of your estates; on your
      arrival, follow the chevalier's advice, if you like; and, what is more,
      you can sleep there as long and as tranquilly as you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! set off!" exclaimed the chevalier, feigning surprise; "why should
      De Guiche set off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, and you cannot be ignorant of it&mdash;you particularly so&mdash;
      because every one is talking about the scene which has passed between
      Monsieur and De Guiche."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all," replied the chevalier, "not at all; and you have been
      wrongly informed, M. de Bragelonne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been perfectly well informed, on the contrary, monsieur," replied
      Raoul, "and the advice I give De Guiche is that of a friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      During this discussion, De Guiche, somewhat shaken, looked alternately
      first at one and then at the other of his advisers. He inwardly felt that
      a game, important in all its consequences for the rest of his life, was
      being played at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not fact," said the chevalier, putting the question to the count
      himself, "is it not fact, De Guiche, that the scene was not so tempestuous
      as the Vicomte de Bragelonne seems to think, and who, moreover, was not
      himself there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whether tempestuous or not," persisted Raoul, "it is not precisely of the
      scene itself that I am speaking, but of the consequences that may ensue. I
      know that Monsieur has threatened, I know that Madame has been in tears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame in tears!" exclaimed De Guiche, imprudently clasping his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said the chevalier, laughing, "this is indeed a circumstance I was
      not acquainted with. You are decidedly better informed than I am, Monsieur
      de Bragelonne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it is because I am better informed than yourself, chevalier, that I
      insist upon De Guiche leaving."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; I regret to differ from you, vicomte; but his departure is
      unnecessary. Why, indeed, should he leave? tell us why."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king!" exclaimed De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I tell you the king has taken up the affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah!" said the chevalier, "the king likes De Guiche, and particularly his
      father; reflect, that, if the count were to leave, it would be an
      admission that he had done something which merited rebuke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt of it; when one runs away, it is either from guilt or fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes, because a man is offended; often because he is wrongfully
      accused," said Bragelonne. "We will assign as a reason for his departure,
      that he feels hurt and injured&mdash;nothing will be easier; we will say
      that we both did our utmost to keep him, and you, at least, will not be
      speaking otherwise than the truth. Come, De Guiche, you are innocent, and,
      being so, the scene of to-day must have wounded you. So set off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, De Guiche, remain where you are," said the chevalier; "precisely as
      M. de Bragelonne has put it, because you are innocent. Once more, forgive
      me, vicomte; but my opinion is the very opposite to your own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are at perfect liberty to maintain it, monsieur; but be assured
      that the exile which De Guiche will voluntarily impose upon himself will
      be of short duration. He can terminate it whenever he pleases, and
      returning from his voluntary exile, he will meet with smiles from all
      lips; while, on the contrary, the anger of the king may now draw down a
      storm upon his head, the end of which no one can foresee."
    </p>
    <p>
      The chevalier smiled, and muttered to himself, "That is the very thing I
      wish." And at the same time he shrugged his shoulders, a movement which
      did not escape the count, who dreaded, if he quitted the court, to seem to
      yield to a feeling of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; I have decided, Bragelonne; I stay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I prophesy, then," said Raoul, sadly, "that misfortune will befall you,
      De Guiche."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, too, am a prophet, but not a prophet of evil; on the contrary, count,
      I say to you, 'remain.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure," inquired De Guiche, "that the repetition of the ballet
      still takes place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you see, Raoul," continued De Guiche, endeavoring to smile, "you
      see, the court is not so very sorrowful, or so readily disposed for
      internal dissensions, when dancing is carried on with such assiduity.
      Come, acknowledge that," said the count to Raoul, who shook his head,
      saying, "I have nothing to add."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," inquired the chevalier, curious to learn whence Raoul had obtained
      his information, the exactitude of which he was inwardly forced to admit,
      "since you say you are well informed, vicomte, how can you be better
      informed than myself, who am one of the prince's most intimate
      companions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To such a declaration I submit. You certainly ought to be perfectly well
      informed, I admit; and, as a man of honor is incapable of saying anything
      but what he knows to be true, or of speaking otherwise than what he
      thinks, I will say no more, but confess myself defeated, and leave you in
      possession of the field of battle."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Raoul, who now seemed only to care to be left quiet, threw
      himself upon a couch, whilst the count summoned his servants to aid him in
      dressing. The chevalier, finding that time was passing away, wished to
      leave; but he feared, too, that Raoul, left alone with De Guiche, might
      yet influence him to change his mind. He therefore made use of his last
      resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame," he said, "will be brilliant; she appears to-day in her costume
      of Pomona."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that is so," exclaimed the count.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she has just given directions in consequence," continued the
      chevalier. "You know, Monsieur de Bragelonne, that the king is to appear
      as Spring."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be admirable," said De Guiche; "and that is a better reason for
      me to remain than any you have yet given, because I am to appear as
      Autumn, and shall have to dance with Madame. I cannot absent myself
      without the king's orders, since my departure would interrupt the ballet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I," said the chevalier, "am to be only a simple <i>egypan</i>; true, it
      is, I am a bad dancer, and my legs are not well made. Gentlemen, adieu. Do
      not forget the basket of fruit, which you are to offer to Pomona, count."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rest assured," said De Guiche, delightedly, "I shall forget nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am now quite certain that he will remain," murmured the Chevalier de
      Lorraine to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul, when the chevalier had left, did not even attempt to dissuade his
      friend, for he felt that it would be trouble thrown away; he merely
      observed to the comte, in his melancholy and melodious voice, "You are
      embarking in a most dangerous enterprise. I know you well; you go to
      extremes in everything, and the lady you love does so, too. Admitting for
      an instant that she should at last love you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, never!" exclaimed De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you say never?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because it would be a great misfortune for both of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, instead of regarding you simply imprudent, I cannot but
      consider you absolutely mad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you perfectly sure&mdash;mind, answer me frankly&mdash;that you do
      not wish her whom you love to make any sacrifice for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes; quite sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love her, then, at a distance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! at a distance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly; what matters being present or absent, since you expect nothing
      from her? Love her portrait, a memento."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Raoul!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love is a shadow, an illusion, a chimera; be devoted to the affection
      itself, in giving a name to your ideality."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You turn away; your servants approach. I will say no more. In good or bad
      fortune, De Guiche, depend on me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed I shall do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; that is all I had to say to you. Spare no pains in your
      person, De Guiche, and look your very best. Adieu."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not be present, then, at the ballet, vicomte?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I shall have a visit to pay in town. Farewell, De Guiche."
    </p>
    <p>
      The reception was to take place in the king's apartments. In the first
      place, there were the queens, then Madame, and a few ladies of the court,
      who had been carefully selected. A great number of courtiers, also
      selected, occupied the time, before the dancing commenced, in conversing,
      as people knew how to converse in those times. None of the ladies who had
      received invitations appeared in the costumes of the <i>fete</i>, as the
      Chevalier de Lorraine had predicted, but many conversations took place
      about the rich and ingenious toilettes designed by different painters for
      the ballet of "The Demi-Gods," for thus were termed the kings and queens
      of which Fontainebleau was about to become the Pantheon. Monsieur arrived,
      holding in his hand a drawing representing his character; he looked
      somewhat anxious; he bowed courteously to the young queen and his mother,
      but saluted Madame almost cavalierly. His notice of her and his coldness
      of manner were observed by all. M. de Guiche indemnified the princess by a
      look of passionate devotion, and it must be admitted that Madame, as she
      raised her eyes, returned it to him with interest. It is unquestionable
      that De Guiche had never looked so handsome, for Madame's glance had its
      customary effect of lighting up the features of the son of the Marshal de
      Gramont. The king's sister-in-law felt a storm mustering above her head;
      she felt, too, that during the whole of the day, so fruitful in future
      events, she had acted unjustly, if not treasonably, towards one who loved
      her with such a depth of devotion. In her eyes the moment seemed to have
      arrived for an acknowledgement to the poor victim of the injustice of the
      morning. Her heart spoke, and murmured the name of De Guiche; the count
      was sincerely pitied and accordingly gained the victory over all others.
      Neither Monsieur, nor the king, nor the Duke of Buckingham, was any longer
      thought of; De Guiche at that moment reigned without a rival. But although
      Monsieur also looked very handsome, still he could not be compared to the
      count. It is well known&mdash;indeed all women say so&mdash;that a wide
      difference invariably exists between the good looks of a lover and those
      of a husband. Besides, in the present case, after Monsieur had left, and
      after the courteous and affectionate recognition of the young queen and of
      the queen-mother, and the careless and indifferent notice of Madame, which
      all the courtiers had remarked; all these motives gave the lover the
      advantage over the husband. Monsieur was too great a personage to notice
      these details. Nothing is so certain as a well settled idea of superiority
      to prove the inferiority of the man who has that opinion of himself. The
      king arrived. Every one looked for what might possibly happen in the
      glance, which began to bestir the world, like the brow of Jupiter Tonans.
      Louis had none of his brother's gloominess, but was perfectly radiant.
      Having examined the greater part of the drawings which were displayed for
      his inspection on every side, he gave his opinion or made his remarks upon
      them, and in this manner rendered some happy and others wretched by a
      single word. Suddenly his glance, which was smilingly directed towards
      Madame, detected the slight correspondence established between the
      princess and the count. He bit his lips, but when he opened them again to
      utter a few commonplace remarks, he said, advancing towards the queens:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have just been informed that everything is now prepared at
      Fontainebleau, in accordance with my directions." A murmur of satisfaction
      arose from the different groups, and the king perceived on every face the
      greatest anxiety to receive an invitation for the <i>fetes</i>. "I shall
      leave to-morrow," he added. Whereupon the profoundest silence immediately
      ensued. "And I invite," said the king, finishing, "all those who are now
      present to get ready to accompany me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Smiling faces were now everywhere visible, with the exception of Monsieur,
      who seemed to retain his ill-humor. The different noblemen and ladies of
      the court thereupon defiled before the king, one after the other, in order
      to thank his majesty for the great honor which had been conferred upon
      them by the invitation. When it came to De Guiche's turn, the king said,
      "Ah! M. de Guiche, I did not see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The comte bowed, and Madame turned pale. De Guiche was about to open his
      lips to express his thanks, when the king said, "Comte, this is the season
      for farming purposes in the country; I am sure your tenants in Normandy
      will be glad to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, after this pitiless attack, turned his back on the poor comte,
      whose turn it was now to become pale; he advanced a few steps towards the
      king, forgetting that the king is never spoken to except in reply to
      questions addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have perhaps misunderstood your majesty," he stammered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king turned his head slightly, and with a cold and stern glance, which
      plunged like a sword relentlessly into the hearts of those under disgrace,
      repeated, "I said retire to your estates," allowing every syllable to fall
      slowly one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
      A cold perspiration bedewed the comte's face, his hands convulsively
      opened, and his hat, which he held between his trembling fingers, fell to
      the ground. Louis sought his mother's glance, as though to show her that
      he was master; he sought his brother's triumphant look, as if to ask him
      if he were satisfied with the vengeance taken; and lastly, his eyes fell
      upon Madame; but the princess was laughing and smiling with Madame de
      Noailles. She heard nothing, or rather had pretended not to hear at all.
      The Chevalier de Lorraine looked on also, with one of those looks of fixed
      hostility that seemed to give to a man's glance the power of a lever when
      it raises an obstacle, wrests it away, and casts it to a distance. M. de
      Guiche was left alone in the king's cabinet, the whole of the company
      having departed. Shadows seemed to dance before his eyes. He suddenly
      broke through the settled despair that overwhelmed him, and flew to hide
      himself in his own room, where Raoul awaited him, immovable in his own sad
      presentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" he murmured, seeing his friend enter, bareheaded, with a wild gaze
      and tottering gait.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, it is true," said De Guiche, unable to utter more, and falling
      exhausted upon the couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she?" inquired Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She," exclaimed his unhappy friend, as he raised his hand clenched in
      anger, towards Heaven. "She!&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did she say and do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She said that her dress suited her admirably, and then she laughed."
    </p>
    <p>
      A fit of hysteric laughter seemed to shatter his nerves, for he fell
      backwards, completely overcome.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXV. Fontainebleau.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For four days, every kind of enchantment brought together in the
      magnificent gardens of Fontainebleau had converted this spot into a place
      of the most perfect enjoyment. M. Colbert seemed gifted with ubiquity. In
      the morning there were the accounts of the previous night's expenses to
      settle; during the day, programmes, essays, enrolments, payments. M.
      Colbert had amassed four millions of francs, and dispersed them with
      sleepless economy. He was horrified at the expenses which mythology
      involved; not a wood nymph, nor a dryad, that cost less than a hundred
      francs a day! The dress alone amounted to three hundred francs. The
      expense of powder and sulphur for fireworks amounted, every night, to a
      hundred thousand francs. In addition to these, the illuminations on the
      borders of the sheet of water cost thirty thousand francs every evening.
      The <i>fetes</i> had been magnificent; and Colbert could not restrain his
      delight. From time to time, he noticed Madame and the king setting forth
      on hunting expeditions, or preparing for the reception of different
      fantastic personages, solemn ceremonials, which had been extemporized a
      fortnight before, and in which Madame's sparkling wit and the king's
      magnificence were equally well displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Madame, the heroine of the <i>fete</i>, replied to the addresses of
      the deputations from unknown races&mdash;Garamanths, Scythians,
      Hyperboreans, Caucasians, and Patagonians, who seemed to issue from the
      ground for the purpose of approaching her with their congratulations; and
      upon every representative of these races the king bestowed a diamond, or
      some other article of value. Then the deputies, in verses more or less
      amusing, compared the king to the sun, Madame to Phoebe, the sun's sister,
      and the queen and Monsieur were no more spoken of than if the king had
      married Henrietta of England, and not Maria Theresa of Austria. The happy
      pair, hand in hand, imperceptibly pressing each other's fingers, drank in
      deep draughts the sweet beverage of adulation, by which the attractions of
      youth, beauty, power and love are enhanced. Every one at Fontainebleau was
      amazed at the extent of the influence which Madame had so rapidly acquired
      over the king, and whispered among themselves that Madame was, in point of
      fact, the true queen; and in effect, the king himself proclaimed its truth
      by his every thought, word, and look. He formed his wishes, he drew his
      inspirations from Madame's eyes, and his delight was unbounded when Madame
      deigned to smile upon him. And was Madame, on her side, intoxicated with
      the power she wielded, as she beheld every one at her feet? This was a
      question she herself could hardly answer; but what she did know was, that
      she could frame no wish, and that she felt herself to be perfectly happy.
      The result of all these changes, the source of which emanated from the
      royal will, was that Monsieur, instead of being the second person in the
      kingdom, had, in reality, become the third. And it was now far worse than
      in the time when De Guiche's guitars were heard in Madame's apartments;
      for, then, at least, Monsieur had the satisfaction of frightening those
      who annoyed him. Since the departure, however, of the enemy, who had been
      driven away by means of his alliance with the king, Monsieur had to submit
      to a burden, heavier, but in a very different sense, to his former one.
      Every evening Madame returned home quite exhausted. Horse-riding, bathing
      in the Seine, spectacles, dinners under the leafy covert of the trees,
      balls on the banks of the grand canal, concerts, etc., etc.; all this
      would have been sufficient to have killed, not a slight and delicate
      woman, but the strongest porter in the <i>chateau</i>. It is perfectly
      true that, with regard to dancing, concerts, and promenades, and such
      matters, a woman is far stronger than the most robust of porters. But,
      however great a woman's strength may be, there is a limit to it, and she
      cannot hold out long under such a system. As for Monsieur, he had not even
      the satisfaction of witnessing Madame's abdication of her royalty in the
      evening, for she lived in the royal pavilion with the young queen and the
      queen-mother. As a matter of course, the Chevalier de Lorraine did not
      quit Monsieur, and did not fail to distil drops of gall into every wound
      the latter received. The result was, that Monsieur&mdash;who had at first
      been in the highest spirits, and completely restored since Guiche's
      departure&mdash;subsided into his melancholy state three days after the
      court was installed at Fontainebleau.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened, however, that, one day, about two o'clock in the afternoon,
      Monsieur, who had risen late, and had bestowed upon his toilet more than
      his usual attention,&mdash;it happened, we repeat, that Monsieur, who had
      not heard of any plans having been arranged for the day, formed the
      project of collecting his own court, and of carrying Madame off with him
      to Moret, where he possessed a charming country house. He accordingly went
      to the queen's pavilion, and was astonished, on entering, to find none of
      the royal servants in attendance. Quite alone, therefore, he entered the
      rooms, a door on the left opening to Madame's apartment, the one on the
      right to the young queen's. In his wife's apartment, Monsieur was
      informed, by a sempstress who was working there, that every one had left
      at eleven o'clock, for the purpose of bathing in the Seine, that a grand
      <i>fete</i> was to be made of the expedition, that all the carriages had
      been placed at the park gates, and that they had all set out more than an
      hour ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good," said Monsieur, "the idea is a good one; the heat is very
      oppressive, and I have no objection to bathe, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      He summoned his servants, but no one came. He summoned those in attendance
      on Madame, but everybody had gone out. He went to the stables, where he
      was informed by a groom that there were no carriages of any description.
      He desired that a couple of horses should be saddled, one for himself and
      the other for his valet. The groom told him that all the horses had been
      sent away. Monsieur, pale with anger, again descended towards the queen's
      apartments, and penetrated as far as Anne of Austria's oratory, where he
      perceived, through the half-opened tapestry-hangings, his young and
      beautiful sister on her knees before the queen-mother, who appeared
      weeping bitterly. He had not been either seen or heard. He cautiously
      approached the opening, and listened, the sight of so much grief having
      aroused his curiosity. Not only was the young queen weeping, but she was
      complaining also. "Yes," she said, "the king neglects me, the king devotes
      himself to pleasures and amusements only, in which I have no share."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Patience, patience, my daughter," said Anne of Austria, in Spanish; and
      then, also in Spanish, added some words of advice, which Monsieur did not
      understand. The queen replied by accusations, mingled with sighs and sobs,
      among which Monsieur often distinguished the word <i>banos</i>, which
      Maria Theresa accentuated with spiteful anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The baths," said Monsieur to himself; "it seems it is the baths that have
      put her out." And he endeavored to put together the disconnected phrases
      which he had been able to understand. It was easy to guess that the queen
      was complaining bitterly, and that, if Anne of Austria did not console
      her, she at least endeavored to do so. Monsieur was afraid to be detected
      listening at the door and he therefore made up his mind to cough; the two
      queens turned round at the sound and Monsieur entered. At sight of the
      prince, the young queen rose precipitately, and dried her tears. Monsieur,
      however, knew the people he had to deal with too well, and was naturally
      too polite to remain silent, and he accordingly saluted them. The
      queen-mother smiled pleasantly at him, saying, "What do you want, Philip?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?&mdash;nothing," stammered Monsieur. "I was looking for&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was looking for Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame is at the baths."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the king?" said Monsieur, in a tone which made the queen tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king also, the whole court as well," replied Anne of Austria.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Except you, madame," said Monsieur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I," said the young queen, "I seem to terrify all those who amuse
      themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so do I,&mdash;judging from appearances," rejoined Monsieur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Austria made a sigh to her daughter-in-law, who withdrew, weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur's brows contracted, as he remarked aloud, "What a cheerless
      house. What do you think of it, mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no; everybody here is pleasure-hunting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed, that is the very thing that makes those dull who do not care
      for pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what a tone you say that, Philip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word, madame, I speak as I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Explain yourself; what is the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask my sister-in-law, rather, who, just now, was detailing all her
      grievances to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her grievances, what&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I was listening; accidentally, I confess, but still I listened&mdash;so
      that I heard only too well my sister complain of those famous baths of
      Madame&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! folly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, no; people are not always foolish when they weep. The queen said
      <i>banos</i>, which means baths."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I repeat, Philip," said Anne of Austria, "that your sister is childishly
      jealous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, madame," replied the prince, "I, too, must with great
      humility accuse myself of possessing the same defect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You also, Philip?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you really jealous of these baths?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why not, madame, when the king goes to the baths with my wife, and
      does not take the queen? Why not, when Madame goes to the baths with the
      king, and does not do me the honor to even invite me? And you enjoin my
      sister-in-law to be satisfied, and require me to be satisfied, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are raving, my dear Philip," said Anne of Austria; "you have driven
      the Duke of Buckingham away; you have been the cause of M. de Guiche's
      exile; do you now wish to send the king away from Fontainebleau?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not pretend to anything of the kind, madame," said Monsieur,
      bitterly; "but, at least, I can withdraw, and I shall do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jealous of the king&mdash;jealous of your brother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, madame, I am jealous of the king&mdash;of my own brother, and
      remarkably jealous, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, Monsieur," exclaimed Anne of Austria, affecting to be indignant,
      "I begin to believe you are mad, and a sworn enemy to my repose. I
      therefore abandon the place to you, for I have no means of defending
      myself against such monomanias."
    </p>
    <p>
      She arose and left Monsieur a prey to the most extravagant transport of
      passion. He remained for a moment completely bewildered; then, recovering
      himself, again went to the stables, found the groom, once more asked him
      for a carriage or a horse, and upon his reply that there was neither the
      one or the other, Monsieur snatched a long whip from the hand of a
      stable-boy, and began to pursue the poor devil of a groom all round the
      servants' courtyard, whipping him the while, in spite of his cries and
      excuses; then, quite out of breath, covered with perspiration, and
      trembling in every limb, he returned to his own apartments, broke in
      pieces some beautiful specimens of porcelain, and then got into bed,
      booted and spurred as he was, crying out for some one to come to him. <a

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXVI. The Bath.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At Vulaines, beneath the impenetrable shade of flowering osiers and
      willows, which, as they bent down their green heads, dipped the
      extremities of their branches in the blue waters, a long and flat-bottomed
      boat, with ladders covered with long blue curtains, served as a refuge for
      the bathing Dianas, who, as they left the water, were watched by twenty
      plumed Acteons, who, eagerly, and full of admiration, galloped up and down
      the flowery banks of the river. But Diana herself, even the chaste Diana,
      clothed in her long chlamys, was less beautiful&mdash;less impenetrable,
      than Madame, as young and beautiful as that goddess herself. For,
      notwithstanding the fine tunic of the huntress, her round and delicate
      knee can be seen; and notwithstanding the sonorous quiver, her brown
      shoulders can be detected; whereas, in Madame's case, a long white veil
      enveloped her, wrapping her round and round a hundred times, as she
      resigned herself into the hands of her female attendants, and thus was
      rendered inaccessible to the most indiscreet, as well as to the most
      penetrating gaze. When she ascended the ladder, the poets were present&mdash;and
      all were poets when Madame was the subject of discussion&mdash;the twenty
      poets who were galloping about, stopped, and with one voice, exclaimed
      that pearls, and not drops of water, were falling from her person, to be
      lost again in the happy river. The king, the center of these effusions,
      and of this respectful homage, imposed silence upon those expatiators, for
      whom it seemed impossible to exhaust their raptures, and he rode away, for
      fear of offending, even through the silken curtains, the modesty of the
      woman and the dignity of the princess. A great blank thereupon ensued in
      the scene, and perfect silence in the boat. From the movements on board&mdash;from
      the flutterings and agitations of the curtains&mdash;the goings to and fro
      of the female attendants engaged in their duties, could be guessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king smilingly listened to the conversation of the courtiers around
      him, but it could easily be perceived that he gave but little, if any,
      attention to their remarks. In fact, hardly had the sound of the rings
      drawn along the curtain-rods announced that Madame was dressed, and that
      the goddess was about to make her reappearance, than the king, returning
      to his former post immediately, and running quite close to the river-bank,
      gave the signal for all those to approach whose duty or pleasure summoned
      them to Madame's side. The pages hurried forward, conducting the led
      horses; the carriages, which had remained sheltered under the trees,
      advanced towards the tent, followed by a crowd of servants, bearers, and
      female attendants, who, while their masters had been bathing, had mutually
      exchanged their own observations, critical remarks, and the discussion of
      matters personal&mdash;the fugitive journal of that period, of which no
      one now remembers anything, not even by the waves, the witnesses of what
      went on that day&mdash;themselves now sublimed into immensity, as the
      actors have vanished into eternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      A crowd of people swarming upon the banks of the river, without reckoning
      the groups of peasants drawn together by their anxiety to see the king and
      the princess, was, for many minutes, the most disorderly, but the most
      agreeable, mob imaginable. The king dismounted from his horse, a movement
      which was imitated by all the courtiers, and offered his hat to Madame,
      whose rich riding-habit displayed her fine figure, which was set off to
      great advantage by that garment, made of fine woolen cloth embroidered
      with silver. Her hair, still damp and blacker than jet, hung in heavy
      masses upon her white and delicate neck. Joy and health sparkled in her
      beautiful eyes; composed, yet full of energy, she inhaled the air in deep
      draughts, under a lace parasol, which was borne by one of her pages.
      Nothing could be more charming, more graceful, more poetical, than these
      two figures buried under the rose-colored shade of the parasol, the king,
      whose white teeth were displayed in continual smiles, and Madame, whose
      black eyes sparkled like carbuncles in the glittering reflection of the
      changing hues of the silk. When Madame approached her horse, a magnificent
      animal of Andalusian breed, of spotless white, somewhat heavy, perhaps,
      but with a spirited and splendid head, in which the mixture, happily
      combined, of Arabian and Spanish blood could be readily traced, and whose
      long tail swept the ground; and as the princess affected difficulty in
      mounting, the king took her in his arms in such a manner that Madame's arm
      was clasped like a circlet of alabaster around the king's neck. Louis, as
      he withdrew, involuntarily touched with his lips the arm, which was not
      withheld, and the princess having thanked her royal equerry, every one
      sprang to his saddle at the same moment. The king and Madame drew aside to
      allow the carriages, the outriders, and runners, to pass by. A fair
      proportion of the cavaliers, released from the restraint etiquette had
      imposed upon them, gave the rein to their horses, and darted after the
      carriages which bore the maids of honor, as blooming as so many virgin
      huntresses around Diana, and the human whirlwind, laughing, chattering,
      and noisy, passed onward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king and Madame, however, kept their horses in hand at a foot-pace.
      Behind his majesty and his sister-in-law, certain of the courtiers &mdash;those,
      at least, who were seriously disposed or were anxious to be within reach,
      or under the eyes, of the king&mdash;followed at a respectful distance,
      restraining their impatient horses, regulating their pace by that of the
      king and Madame, and abandoned themselves to all the delight and
      gratification which is to be found in the conversation of clever people,
      who can, with perfect courtesy, make a thousand atrocious, but laughable
      remarks about their neighbors. In their stifled laughter, and in the
      little reticences of their sardonic humor, Monsieur, the poor absentee,
      was not spared. But they pitied, and bewailed greatly, the fate of De
      Guiche, and it must be confessed that their compassion, as far as he was
      concerned, was not misplaced. The king and Madame having breathed the
      horses, and repeated a hundred times over such remarks as the courtiers,
      who supplied them with talk, suggested to them, set off at a hand gallop,
      and the leafy coverts of the forest resounded to the footfalls of the
      mounted party. To the conversations beneath the shade of the trees,&mdash;to
      remarks made in the shape of confidential communications, and
      observations, mysteriously exchanged, succeeded the noisiest bursts of
      laughter;&mdash;from the very outriders to royalty itself, merriment
      seemed to spread. Every one began to laugh and to cry out. The magpies and
      the jays fluttered away uttering their guttural cries, beneath the waving
      avenues of oaks; the cuckoo staid his monotonous cry in the recesses of
      the forest; the chaffinch and tomtit flew away in clouds; while the
      terrified deer bounded riverwards from the midst of the thickets. This
      crowd, spreading joy, confusion, and light wherever it passed, was
      heralded, it may be said, to the chateau by its own clamor. As the king
      and Madame entered the village, they were received by the acclamations of
      the crowd. Madame hastened to look for Monsieur, for she instinctively
      understood that he had been far too long kept from sharing in this joy.
      The king went to rejoin the queens; he knew he owed them&mdash;one
      especially&mdash;a compensation for his long absence. But Madame was not
      admitted to Monsieur's apartments, and she was informed that Monsieur was
      asleep. The king, instead of being met by Maria Theresa smiling, as was
      usual with her, found Anne of Austria in the gallery watching for his
      return, who advanced to meet him, and taking him by the hand, led him to
      her own apartment. No one ever knew what was the nature of the
      conversation which took place between them, or rather what it was that the
      queen-mother said to Louis XIV.; but the general tenor of the interview
      might certainly be guessed from the annoyed expression of the king's face
      as he left her.

      interview. It will be found sufficiently detailed, at least we hope so, in
      the following chapter.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXVII. The Butterfly-Chase.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king, on retiring to his apartments to give some directions and to
      arrange his ideas, found on his toilette-glass a small note, the
      handwriting of which seemed disguised. He opened it and read&mdash;"Come
      quickly, I have a thousand things to say to you." The king and Madame had
      not been separated a sufficiently long time for these thousand things to
      be the result of the three thousand which they had been saying to each
      other during the route which separated Vulaines from Fontainebleau. The
      confused and hurried character of the note gave the king a great deal to
      reflect upon. He occupied himself but slightly with his toilette, and set
      off to pay his visit to Madame. The princess, who did not wish to have the
      appearance of expecting him, had gone into the gardens with the ladies of
      her suite. When the king was informed that Madame had left her apartments
      and had gone for a walk in the gardens, he collected all the gentlemen he
      could find, and invited them to follow him. He found Madame engaged in
      chasing butterflies, on a large lawn bordered with heliotrope and
      flowering broom. She was looking on as the most adventurous and youngest
      of her ladies ran to and fro, and with her back turned to a high hedge,
      very impatiently awaited the arrival of the king, with whom she had
      appointed the rendezvous. The sound of many feet upon the gravel walk made
      her turn round. Louis XIV. was hatless, he had struck down with his cane a
      peacock butterfly, which Monsieur de Saint-Aignan had picked up from the
      ground quite stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, Madame," said the king, as he approached her, "that I, too, am
      hunting on your behalf!" and then, turning towards those who had
      accompanied him, said, "Gentlemen, see if each of you cannot obtain as
      much for these ladies," a remark which was a signal for all to retire. And
      thereupon a curious spectacle might have been observed; old and corpulent
      courtiers were seen running after butterflies, losing their hats as they
      ran, and with their raised canes cutting down the myrtles and the furze,
      as they would have done the Spaniards.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king offered Madame his arm, and they both selected, as the center of
      observation, a bench with a roof of boards and moss, a kind of hut roughly
      designed by the modest genius of one of the gardeners who had inaugurated
      the picturesque and fanciful amid the formal style of the gardening of
      that period. This sheltered retreat, covered with nasturtiums and climbing
      roses, screened the bench, so that the spectators, insulated in the middle
      of the lawn, saw and were seen on every side, but could not be heard,
      without perceiving those who might approach for the purpose of listening.
      Seated thus, the king made a sign of encouragement to those who were
      running about; and then, as if he were engaged with Madame in a
      dissertation upon the butterfly, which he had thrust through with a gold
      pin and fastened on his hat, said to her, "How admirably we are placed
      here for conversations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire, for I wished to be heard by you alone, and yet to be seen by
      every one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I also," said Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My note surprised you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Terrified me rather. But what I have to tell you is more important."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It cannot be, sire. Do you know that Monsieur refuses to see me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you not guess why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Madame! in that case we have both the same thing to say to each
      other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has happened to you, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wish me to begin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, for I have told you all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, as soon as I returned, I found my mother waiting for me, and
      she led me away to her own apartments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The queen-mother?" said Madame, with some anxiety, "the matter is serious
      then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed it is, for she told me... but, in the first place, allow me to
      preface what I have to say with one remark. Has Monsieur ever spoken to
      you about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Often."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he ever spoken to you about his jealousy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More frequently still."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of his jealousy of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, but of the Duke of Buckingham and De Guiche."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Madame, Monsieur's present idea is a jealousy of myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really," replied the princess, smiling archly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And it really seems to me," continued the king, "that we have never given
      any ground&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never! at least <i>I</i> have not. But who told you that Monsieur was
      jealous?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother represented to me that Monsieur entered her apartments like a
      madman, that he uttered a thousand complaints against you, and&mdash;forgive
      me for saying it&mdash;against your coquetry. It appears that Monsieur
      indulges in injustice, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very kind, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother reassured him; but he pretended that people reassure him too
      often, and that he had had quite enough of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would it not be better for him not to make himself uneasy in any way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very thing I said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confess, sire, that the world is very wicked. Is it possible that a
      brother and sister cannot converse together, or take pleasure in each
      other's company, without giving rise to remarks and suspicions? For
      indeed, sire, we are doing no harm, and have no intention of doing any."
      And she looked at the king with that proud yet provoking glance that
      kindles desire in the coldest and wisest of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!" sighed the king, "that is true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know very well, sire, that if it were to continue, I should be
      obliged to make a disturbance. Do you decide upon our conduct, and say
      whether it has, or has not, been perfectly correct."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, certainly&mdash;perfectly correct."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Often alone together,&mdash;for we delight in the same things,&mdash;we
      might possibly be led away into error, but <i>have</i> we been? I regard
      you as a brother, and nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king frowned. She continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your hand, which often meets my own, does not excite in me that agitation
      and emotion which is the case with those who love each other, for instance&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough," said the king, "enough, I entreat you. You have no pity&mdash;you
      are killing me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In fact, then, you distinctly say you experience nothing when near me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sire! I don't say that&mdash;my affection&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough, Henrietta, I again entreat you. If you believe me to be marble,
      as you are, undeceive yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not understand you, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said the king, casting down his eyes. "And so our meetings,
      the pressure of each other's hand, the looks we have exchanged&mdash;Yes,
      yes; you are right, and I understand your meaning," and he buried his face
      in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, sire," said Madame, hurriedly, "Monsieur de Saint-Aignan is
      looking at you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said Louis, angrily; "never even the shadow of liberty! never
      any sincerity in my intercourse with any one! I imagine I have found a
      friend, who is nothing but a spy; a dearer friend, who is only a&mdash;sister!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame was silent, and cast down her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My husband is jealous," she murmured, in a tone of which nothing could
      equal its sweetness and charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," exclaimed the king, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see," she said, looking at him in a manner that set his heart on
      fire, "you are free, you are not suspected, the peace of your house is not
      disturbed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas," said the king, "as yet you know nothing, for the queen is
      jealous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maria Theresa!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stark mad with jealousy! Monsieur's jealousy arises from hers; she was
      weeping and complaining to my mother, and was reproaching us for those
      bathing parties, which have made me so happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And me too," answered Madame, by a look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When, suddenly," continued the king, "Monsieur, who was listening, heard
      the word '<i>banos</i>,' which the queen pronounced with some degree of
      bitterness, that awakened his attention; he entered the room, looking
      quite wild, broke into the conversation, and began to quarrel with my
      mother so bitterly that she was obliged to leave him; so that, while you
      have a jealous husband to deal with, I shall have perpetually present
      before me a specter of jealousy with swollen eyes, a cadaverous face, and
      sinister looks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor king," murmured Madame, as she lightly touched the king's hand. He
      retained her hand in his, and in order to press it without exciting
      suspicion in the spectators, who were not so much taken up with the
      butterflies that they could not occupy themselves about other matters, and
      who perceived clearly enough that there was some mystery in the king's and
      Madame's conversation, Louis placed the dying butterfly before his
      sister-in-law, and bent over it as if to count the thousand eyes of its
      wings, or the particles of golden dust which covered it. Neither of them
      spoke; however, their hair mingled, their breaths united, and their hands
      feverishly throbbed in each other's grasp. Five minutes passed in this
      manner.

    <h2>
      Chapter XXXVIII. What Was Caught after the Butterflies.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The two young people remained for a moment with their heads bent down,
      bowed, as it were, beneath the double thought of the love which was
      springing up in their hearts, and which gives birth to so many happy
      fancies in the imaginations of twenty years of age. Henrietta gave a side
      glance, from time to time, at the king. Hers was one of those
      finely-organized natures capable of looking inwardly at itself, as well as
      at others at the same moment. She perceived Love lying at the bottom of
      Louis's heart, as a skillful diver sees a pearl at the bottom of the sea.
      She knew Louis was hesitating, if not in doubt, and that his indolent or
      timid heart required aid and encouragement. "And so?" she said,
      interrogatively, breaking the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" inquired Louis, after a moment's pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean, that I shall be obliged to return to the resolution I had
      formed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To what resolution?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To that which I have already submitted to your majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the very day we had a certain explanation about Monsieur's
      jealousies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you say to me then?" inquired Louis, with some anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not remember, sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! if it be another cause of unhappiness, I shall recollect it soon
      enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A cause of unhappiness for myself alone, sire," replied Madame Henrietta;
      "but as it is necessary, I must submit to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least, tell me what it is," said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still that unkind resolve?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe me, sire, I have not found it without a violent struggle with
      myself; it is absolutely necessary I should return to England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never, never will I permit you to leave France," exclaimed the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet, sire," said Madame, affecting a gentle yet sorrowful
      determination, "nothing is more urgently necessary; nay, more than that, I
      am persuaded it is your mother's desire I should do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Desire!" exclaimed the king; "that is a very strange expression to use to
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still," replied Madame Henrietta, smilingly, "are you not happy in
      submitting to the wishes of so good a mother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough, I implore you; you rend my very soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; for you speak of your departure with tranquillity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was not born for happiness, sire," replied the princess, dejectedly;
      "and I acquired, in very early life, the habit of seeing my dearest wishes
      disappointed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you speak truly?" said the king. "Would your departure gainsay any one
      of your cherished thoughts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I were to say 'yes,' would you begin to take your misfortune
      patiently?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How cruel you are!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, sire; some one is coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king looked all round him, and said, "No, there is no one," and then
      continued: "Come, Henrietta, instead of trying to contend against
      Monsieur's jealousy by a departure which would kill me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Henrietta slightly shrugged her shoulders like a woman unconvinced. "Yes,"
      repeated Louis, "which would kill me, I say. Instead of fixing your mind
      on this departure, does not your imagination&mdash;or rather does not your
      heart&mdash;suggest some expedient?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it you wish my heart to suggest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, how can one prove to another that it is wrong to be jealous?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place, sire, by giving no motive for jealousy; in other
      words, in loving no one but the person in question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I expected more than that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you expect?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you would simply tell me that jealous people are pacified by
      concealing the affection which is entertained for the object of jealousy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dissimulation is difficult, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet it is only be means of conquering difficulties that any happiness is
      attained. As far as I am concerned, I swear I will give the lie to those
      who are jealous of me by pretending to treat you like any other woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A bad, as well as unsafe, means," said the young princess, shaking her
      pretty head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to think everything bad, dear Henrietta," said Louis,
      discontentedly. "You negative everything I propose. Suggest, at least,
      something else in its stead. Come, try and think. I trust implicitly to a
      woman's invention. Do you invent in your turn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sire, I have hit upon something. Will you listen to it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you ask me? You speak of a matter of life or death to me, and then
      ask if I will listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I judge of it by my own case. If my husband intended to put me on
      the wrong scent with regard to another woman, one thing would reassure me
      more than anything else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would that be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place to see that he never took any notice of the woman in
      question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. That is precisely what I said just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; but in order to be perfectly reassured on the subject, I
      should like to see him occupy himself with some one else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! I understand you," replied Louis, smiling. "But confess, dear
      Henrietta, if the means is at least ingenious, it is hardly charitable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In curing the dread of a wound in a jealous person's mind, you inflict
      one upon the heart. His fear ceases, it is true; but the evil still
      exists; and that seems to me to be far worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Agreed; but he does not detect, he does not suspect the real enemy; he
      does no prejudice to love itself; he concentrates all his strength on the
      side where his strength will do no injury to anything or any one. In a
      word, sire, my plan, which I confess I am surprised to find you dispute,
      is mischievous to jealous people, it is true; but to lovers it is full of
      advantage. Besides, let me ask, sire, who, except yourself, has ever
      thought of pitying jealous people? Are they not a melancholy crew of
      grumblers always equally unhappy, whether with or without a cause? You may
      remove that cause, but you never can remove their sufferings. It is a
      disease which lies in the imagination, and, like all imaginary disorders,
      it is incurable. By the by, I remember an aphorism upon this subject, of
      poor Dr. Dawley, a clever and amusing man, who, had it not been for my
      brother, who could not do without him, I should have with me now. He used
      to say, 'Whenever you are likely to suffer from two affections, choose
      that which will give you the least trouble, and I will allow you to retain
      it; for it is positive,' he said, 'that that very ailment is of the
      greatest service to me, in order to enable me to get rid of the other.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well and judiciously remarked, Henrietta," replied the king, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! we have some clever people in London, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And those clever people produce adorable pupils. I will grant this Daley,
      Darley, Dawley, or whatever you call him, a pension for his aphorism; but
      I entreat you, Henrietta, to begin by choosing the least of your evils.
      You do not answer&mdash;you smile. I guess that the least of your bugbears
      is your stay in France. I will allow you to retain this information; and,
      in order to begin with the cure of the other, I will this very day begin
      to look out for a subject which shall divert the attention of the jealous
      members of either sex who persecute us both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush! this time some one is really coming," said Madame; and she stooped
      to gather a flower from the thick grass at her feet. Some one, in fact,
      was approaching; for, suddenly, a bevy of young girls ran down from the
      top of the hillock, following the cavaliers&mdash;the cause of this
      interruption being a magnificent hawk-moth, with wings like rose-leaves.
      The prey in question had fallen into the net of Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente, who displayed it with some pride to her less successful
      rivals. The queen of the chase had seated herself some twenty paces from
      the bank on which Louis and Madame Henrietta were reclining; and leaned
      her back against a magnificent oak-tree entwined with ivy, and stuck the
      butterfly on the long cane she carried in her hand. Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente was very beautiful, and the gentlemen, accordingly,
      deserted her companions, and under the pretext of complimenting her upon
      her success, pressed in a circle around her. The king and princess looked
      gloomily at this scene, as spectators of maturer age look on at the games
      of little children. "They seem to be amusing themselves there," said the
      king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Greatly, sire; I have always found that people are amused wherever youth
      and beauty are to be found."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think of Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, Henrietta?"
      inquired the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think she has rather too much flax-yellow and lily-whiteness in her
      complexion," replied Madame, fixing in a moment upon the only fault it was
      possible to find in the almost perfect beauty of the future Madame de
      Montespan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather too fair, yes; but beautiful, I think, in spite of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that your opinion, sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, really."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; and it is mine, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she seems to be much sought after."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On, that is a matter of course. Lovers flutter from one to another. If we
      had hunted for lovers instead of butterflies, you can see, from those who
      surround her, what successful sport we should have had."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, Henrietta, what would be said if the king were to make himself
      one of those lovers, and let his glance fall in that direction? Would some
      one else be jealous, in such a case?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! sire, Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente is a very efficacious remedy,"
      said Madame, with a sigh. "She would cure a jealous man, certainly; but
      she might possibly make a woman jealous, too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Henrietta," exclaimed Louis, "you fill my heart with joy. Yes, yes;
      Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente is far too beautiful to serve as a cloak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A king's cloak," said Madame Henrietta, smiling, "ought to be beautiful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you advise me to do it, then?" inquired Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I! what should I say, sire, except that to give such an advice would be
      to supply arms against myself? It would be folly or pride to advise you to
      take, for the heroine of an assumed affection, a woman more beautiful than
      the one for whom you pretend to feel real regard."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king tried to take Madame's hand in his own; his eyes sought hers; and
      then he murmured a few words so full of tenderness, but pronounced in so
      low a tone, that the historian, who ought to hear everything, could not
      hear them. Then, speaking aloud, he said, "Do you yourself choose for me
      the one who is to cure our jealous friend. To her, then, all my devotion,
      all my attention, all the time that I can spare from my occupations, shall
      be devoted. For her shall be the flower that I may pluck for you, the fond
      thoughts with which you have inspired me. Towards her I will direct the
      glance I dare not bestow upon you, and which ought to be able to rouse you
      from your indifference. But, be careful in your selection, lest, in
      offering her the rose which I may have plucked, I find myself conquered by
      you; and my looks, my hand, my lips, turn immediately towards you, even
      were the whole world to guess my secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      While these words escaped from the king's lips, in a stream of wild
      affection, Madame blushed, breathless, happy, proud, almost intoxicated
      with delight. She could find nothing to say in reply; her pride and her
      thirst for homage were satisfied. "I shall fail," she said, raising her
      beautiful black eyes, "but not as you beg me, for all this incense which
      you wish to burn on the altar of another divinity. Ah! sire, I too shall
      be jealous of it, and want restored to me; and would not that a particle
      of it should be lost in the way. Therefore, sire, with your royal
      permission, I will choose one who shall appear to me the least likely to
      distract your attention, and who will leave my image intact and unshadowed
      in your heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happily for me," said the king, "your heart is not hard and unfeeling. If
      it were so, I should be alarmed at the threat you hold out. Precautions
      were taken on this point, and around you, as around myself, it would be
      difficult to meet with a disagreeable-looking face."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst the king was speaking, Madame had risen from her seat, looked
      around the greensward, and after a careful and silent examination, she
      called the king to her side, and said, "See yonder, sire, upon the
      declivity of that little hill, near that group of Guelder roses, that
      beautiful girl walking alone, her head down, her arms hanging by her side,
      with her eyes fixed upon the flowers, which she crushes beneath her feet,
      like one who is lost in thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle de Valliere, do you mean?" remarked the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will she not suit you, sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, look how thin the poor child is. She has hardly any flesh upon her
      bones."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay: am I stout then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is so melancholy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The greater contrast to myself, who am accused of being too lively."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is lame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt of it. Look; she has allowed every one to pass by her, through
      fear of her defect being remarked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, she will not run so fast as Daphne, and will not be as able to
      escape Apollo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Henrietta," said the king, out of temper; "of all your maids of honor,
      you have really selected for me the one most full of defects."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still she is one of my maids of honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course; but what do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that, in order to visit this new divinity, you will not be able to
      do so without paying a visit to my apartments, and that, as propriety will
      forbid your conversing with her in private, you will be compelled to see
      her in my circle, to speak, as it were, at me, while speaking to her. I
      mean, in fact, that those who may be jealous, will be wrong if they
      suppose you come to my apartments for my sake, since you will go there for
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who happens to be lame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hardly that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who never opens her lips."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who, when she does open them, displays a beautiful set of teeth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who may serve as a model for an osteologist."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your favor will change her appearance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Henrietta!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events you allowed me to choose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my choice is made: I impose her upon you, and you must submit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I would accept one of the furies, if you were to insist upon it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "La Valliere is as gentle as a lamb: do not fear she will ever contradict
      you when you tell her you love her," said Madame, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not afraid, are you, that I shall say too much to her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be for my sake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The treaty is agreed to, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not only so, but signed. You will continue to show me the friendship of a
      brother, the attention of a brother, the gallantry of a monarch, will you
      not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will preserve for you intact a heart that has already become accustomed
      to beat only at your command."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, do you not see that we have guaranteed the future by this
      means?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will your mother cease to regard me as an enemy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will Maria Theresa leave off speaking in Spanish before Monsieur, who has
      a horror of conversation held in foreign languages, because he always
      thinks he is being ill spoken of? and lastly," continued the princess,
      "will people persist in attributing a wrongful affection to the king when
      the truth is, we can offer nothing to each other, except absolute
      sympathy, free from mental reservation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," said the king, hesitatingly. "But other things may still be
      said of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can be said, sire? shall we never be left in tranquillity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "People will say I am deficient in taste; but what is my self-respect in
      comparison with your tranquillity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In comparison with my honor, sire, and that of our family, you mean.
      Besides, I beg you to attend, do not be so hastily prejudiced against La
      Valliere. She is slightly lame, it is true, but she is not deficient in
      good sense. Moreover, all that the king touches is converted into gold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Madame, rest assured of one thing, namely, that I am still grateful
      to you: you might even yet make me pay dearer for your stay in France."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, some one approaches."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One last word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are prudent and judicious, sire; but in the present instance you will
      be obliged to summon to your aid all your prudence, and all your
      judgment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" exclaimed Louis, laughing, "from this very day I shall begin to act
      my part, and you shall see whether I am not quite fit to represent the
      character of a tender swain. After luncheon, there will be a promenade in
      the forest, and then there is supper and the ballet at ten o'clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ardor of my passion shall blaze more brilliantly than the fireworks,
      shall shine more steadily than our friend Colbert's lamps; it shall shine
      so dazzlingly that the queens and Monsieur will be almost blinded by it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, sire, take care."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Heaven's name, what have I done, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall begin to recall the compliments I paid you just now. You prudent!
      you wise! did I say? Why, you begin by the most reckless inconsistencies!
      Can a passion be kindled in this manner, like a torch, in a moment? Can a
      monarch, such as you are, without any preparation, fall at the feet of a
      girl like La Valliere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Henrietta, now I understand you. We have not yet begun the campaign,
      and you are plundering me already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I am only recalling you to common-sense ideas. Let your passion be
      kindled gradually, instead of allowing it to burst forth so suddenly.
      Jove's thunders and lightnings are heard and seen before the palace is set
      on fire. Everything has its commencements. If you are so easily excited,
      no one will believe you are really captivated, and every one will think
      you out of your senses&mdash;if even, indeed, the truth itself not be
      guessed. The public is not so fatuous as they seem."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was obliged to admit that Madame was an angel for sense, and the
      very reverse for cleverness. He bowed, and said: "Agreed, Madame, I will
      think over my plan of attack: great military men&mdash;my cousin De Conde
      for instance&mdash;grow pale in meditation upon their strategical plans,
      before they move one of the pawns, which people call armies; I therefore
      wish to draw up a complete plan of campaign; for you know that the tender
      passion is subdivided in a variety of ways. Well, then, I shall stop at
      the village of Little Attentions, at the hamlet of Love-Letters, before I
      follow the road of Visible Affection; the way is clear enough, you know,
      and poor Madame de Scudery would never forgive me for passing though a
      halting-place without stopping."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! now we have returned to our proper senses, shall we say adieu, sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! it must be so, for see, we are interrupted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed," said Henrietta, "they are bringing Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente and her sphinx butterfly in grand procession this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is perfectly well understood, that this evening, during the promenade,
      I am to make my escape into the forest, and find La Valliere without you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will take care to send her away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well! I will speak to her when she is with her companions, and I
      will then discharge my first arrow at her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be skillful," said Madame, laughing, "and do not miss the heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the princess took leave of the king, and went forward to meet the
      merry troop, which was advancing with much ceremony, and a great many
      pretended flourishes of trumpets, imitated with their mouths.

      Chapter XXXIX. The Ballet of the Seasons.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the conclusion of the banquet, which was served at five o'clock, the
      king entered his cabinet, where his tailors were awaiting him for the
      purpose of trying on the celebrated costume representing Spring, which was
      the result of so much imagination, and had cost so many efforts of thought
      to the designers and ornament-workers of the court. As for the ballet
      itself, every person knew the part he had to take in it, and how to
      perform it. The king had resolved to make it surprise. Hardly, therefore,
      had he finished his conference, and entered his own apartment, than he
      desired his two masters of the ceremonies, Villeroy and Saint-Aignan, to
      be sent for. Both replied that they only awaited his orders, and that
      everything was ready to begin, but that it was necessary to be sure of
      fine weather and a favorable night before these orders could be carried
      out. The king opened his window; the pale-gold hues of the evening were
      visible on the horizon through the vistas of the wood, and the moon, white
      as snow, was already mounting the heavens. Not a ripple could be noticed
      on the surface of the green waters; the swans themselves, even, reposing
      with folded wings like ships at anchor, seemed inspirations of the warmth
      of the air, the freshness of the water, and the silence of the beautiful
      evening. The king, having observed all these things, and contemplated the
      magnificent picture before him, gave the order which De Villeroy and De
      Saint-Aignan awaited; but with a view of insuring the execution of this
      order in a royal manner, one last question was necessary, and Louis XIV.
      put it to the two gentlemen in the following manner:&mdash;"Have you any
      money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire," replied Saint-Aignan, "we have arranged everything with M.
      Colbert."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! very well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire, and M. Colbert said he would wait upon your majesty, as soon
      as your majesty should manifest an intention of carrying out the <i>fetes</i>,
      of which he has furnished the programme."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him come in, then," said the king; and as if Colbert had been
      listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself <i>au courant</i>
      with the conversation, he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his
      name to the two courtiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! M. Colbert," said the king. "Gentlemen, to your posts," whereupon
      Saint-Aignan and Villeroy took their leave. The king seated himself in an
      easy-chair near the window, saying: "The ballet will take place this
      evening, M. Colbert."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, sire, I will pay all accounts to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I promised the tradespeople to pay their bills the day following that on
      which the ballet should take place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, M. Colbert, pay them, since you have promised to do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, sire; but I must have money to do that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! have not the four millions, which M. Fouquet promised, been sent? I
      forgot to ask you about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, they were sent at the hour promised."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sire, the colored lamps, the fireworks, the musicians, and the
      cooks, have swallowed up four millions in eight days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Entirely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the last penny. Every time your majesty directed the banks of the
      grand canal to be illuminated, as much oil was consumed as there was water
      in the basins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, M. Colbert; the fact is, then, you have no more money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no more, sire, but M. Fouquet has," Colbert replied, his face
      darkening with a sinister expression of pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" inquired Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have already made M. Fouquet advance six millions. He has given them
      with too much grace not to have others still to give, if they are
      required, which is the case at the present moment. It is necessary,
      therefore, that he should comply."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king frowned. "M. Colbert," said he, accentuating the financier's
      name, "that is not the way I understood the matter; I do not wish to make
      use, against any of my servants, of a means of pressure which may oppress
      him and fetter his services. In eight days M. Fouquet has furnished six
      millions; that is a good round sum."
    </p>
    <p>
      Colbert turned pale. "And yet," he said, "your majesty did not use this
      language some time ago, when the news about Belle-Isle arrived, for
      instance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, M. Colbert."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, however, has changed since then; on the contrary, indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my thoughts, monsieur, everything has changed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does your majesty then no longer believe the disloyal attempt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My affairs concern myself alone, monsieur; and I have already told you I
      transact them without interference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, I perceive," said Colbert, trembling with anger and fear, "that I
      have had the misfortune to fall into disgrace with your majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all; you are, on the contrary, most agreeable to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet, sire," said the minister, with a certain affected bluntness, so
      successful when it was a question of flattering Louis's self-esteem, "what
      use is there in being agreeable to your majesty, if one can no longer be
      of any use?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I reserve your services for a better occasion; and believe me, they will
      only be the better appreciated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty's plan, then, in this affair, is&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want money, M. Colbert?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seven hundred thousand francs, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will take them from my private treasure." Colbert bowed. "And," added
      Louis, "as it seems a difficult matter for you, notwithstanding your
      economy, to defray, with so limited a sum, the expenses which I intend to
      incur, I will at once sign an order for three millions."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king took a pen and signed an order immediately, then handed it to
      Colbert. "Be satisfied, M. Colbert, the plan I have adopted is one worthy
      of a king," said Louis XIV., who pronounced these words with all the
      majesty he knew how to assume in such circumstances; and dismissed Colbert
      for the purpose of giving an audience to his tailors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The order issued by the king was known throughout the whole of
      Fontainebleau; it was already known, too, that the king was trying on his
      costume, and that the ballet would be danced in the evening. The news
      circulated with the rapidity of lightning; during its progress it kindled
      every variety of coquetry, desire, and wild ambition. At the same moment,
      as if by enchantment, every one who knew how to hold a needle, every one
      who could distinguish a coat from a pair of trousers, was summoned to the
      assistance of those who had received invitations. The king had completed
      his toilette by nine o'clock; he appeared in an open carriage decorated
      with branches of trees and flowers. The queens had taken their seats upon
      a magnificent dias or platform, erected upon the borders of the lake, in a
      theater of wonderful elegance of construction. In the space of five hours
      the carpenters had put together all the different parts connected with the
      building; the upholsterers had laid down the carpets, erected the seats;
      and, as if at the wave of an enchanter's wand, a thousand arms, aiding,
      instead of interfering with each other, had constructed the building,
      amidst the sound of music; whilst, at the same time, other workmen
      illuminated the theater and the shores of the lake with an incalculable
      number of lamps. As the heavens, set with stars, were perfectly unclouded,
      as not even a breath of air could be heard in the woods, and as if Nature
      itself had yielded complacently to the king's fancies, the back of the
      theater had been left open; so that, behind the foreground of the scenes,
      could be seen as a background the beautiful sky, glittering with stars;
      the sheet of water, illuminated by the lights which were reflected in it;
      and the bluish outline of the grand masses of woods, with their rounded
      tops. When the king made his appearance, the theater was full, and
      presented to the view one vast group, dazzling with gold and precious
      stones; in which, however, at the first glance, no single face could be
      distinguished. By degrees, as the sight became accustomed to so much
      brilliancy, the rarest beauties appeared to the view, as in the evening
      sky the stars appear one by one to him who closes his eyes and then opens
      them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theater represented a grove of trees; a few fauns lifting up their
      cloven feet were jumping about; a dryad made her appearance on the scene,
      and was immediately pursued by them; others gathered round her for her
      defense, and they quarrelled as they danced. Suddenly, for the purpose of
      restoring peace and order, Spring, accompanied by his whole court, made
      his appearance. The Elements, subaltern powers of mythology, together with
      their attributes, hastened to follow their gracious sovereign. The
      Seasons, allies of Spring, followed him closely, to form a quadrille,
      which, after many words of more or less flattering import, was the
      commencement of the dance. The music, hautboys, flutes, and viols, was
      delightfully descriptive of rural delights. The king had already made his
      appearance, amid thunders of applause. He was dressed in a tunic of
      flowers, which set off his graceful and well-formed figure to advantage.
      His legs, the best-shaped at court, were displayed to great advantage in
      flesh-colored silken hose, of silk so fine and so transparent that it
      seemed almost like flesh itself. The most beautiful pale-lilac satin
      shoes, with bows of flowers and leaves, imprisoned his small feet. The
      bust of the figure was in harmonious keeping with the base; Louis's waving
      hair floated on his shoulders, the freshness of his complexion was
      enhanced by the brilliancy of his beautiful blue eyes, which softly
      kindled all hearts; a mouth with tempting lips, which deigned to open in
      smiles. Such was the prince of that period: justly that evening styled
      "The King of all the Loves." There was something in his carriage which
      resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal, and he did not dance so
      much as seem to soar along. His entrance produced, therefore, the most
      brilliant effect. Suddenly the Comte de Saint-Aignan was observed
      endeavoring to approach either the king or Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess&mdash;who was robed in a long dress, diaphanous and light as
      the finest network tissue from the hands of skillful Mechlin workers, one
      knee occasionally revealed beneath the folds of the tunic, and her little
      feet encased in silken slippers decked with pearls&mdash;advanced radiant
      with beauty, accompanied by her <i>cortege</i> of Bacchantes, and had
      already reached the spot assigned to her in the dance. The applause
      continued so long that the comte had ample leisure to join the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter, Saint-Aignan?" said Spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing whatever," replied the courtier, as pale as death; "but your
      majesty has not thought of Fruits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; it is suppressed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Far from it, sire; your majesty having given no directions about it, the
      musicians have retained it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How excessively annoying," said the king. "This figure cannot be
      performed, since M. de Guiche is absent. It must be suppressed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, sire, a quarter of an hour's music without any dancing will produce
      an effect so chilling as to ruin the success of the ballet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, come, since&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sire, that is not the greatest misfortune; for, after all, the
      orchestra could still just as well cut it out, if it were necessary; but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, M. de Guiche is here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here?" replied the king, frowning, "here? Are you sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire; and ready dressed for the ballet."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king felt himself color deeply, and said, "You are probably mistaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So little is that the case, sire, that if your majesty will look to the
      right, you will see that the comte is in waiting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis turned hastily towards the side, and in fact, on his right,
      brilliant in his character of Autumn, De Guiche awaited until the king
      should look at him, in order that he might address him. To give an idea of
      the stupefaction of the king, and that of Monsieur, who was moving about
      restlessly in his box,&mdash;to describe also the agitated movement of the
      heads in the theater, and the strange emotion of Madame, at the sight of
      her partner,&mdash;is a task we must leave to abler hands. The king stood
      almost gaping with astonishment as he looked at the comte, who, bowing
      lowly, approached Louis with the profoundest respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire," he said, "your majesty's most devoted servant approaches to
      perform a service on this occasion with similar zeal that he has already
      shown on the field of battle. Your majesty, in omitting the dance of the
      Fruits, would be losing the most beautiful scene in the ballet. I did not
      wish to be the substance of so dark a shadow to your majesty's elegance,
      skill, and graceful invention; and I have left my tenants in order to
      place my services at your majesty's commands."
    </p>
    <p>
      Every word fell distinctly, in perfect harmony and eloquence, upon Louis
      XIV.'s ears. Their flattery pleased, as much as De Guiche's courage had
      astonished him, and he simply replied: "I did not tell you to return,
      comte."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not, sire; but your majesty did not tell me to remain."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king perceived that time was passing away, that if this strange scene
      were prolonged it would complicate everything, and that a single cloud
      upon the picture would eventually spoil the whole. Besides, the king's
      heart was filled with two or three new ideas; he had just derived fresh
      inspiration from the eloquent glances of Madame. Her look had said to him:
      "Since they are jealous of you, divide their suspicions, for the man who
      distrusts two rivals does not object to either in particular." So that
      Madame, by this clever diversion, decided him. The king smiled upon De
      Guiche, who did not comprehend a word of Madame's dumb language, but he
      remarked that she pretended not to look at him, and he attributed the
      pardon which had been conferred upon him to the princess's kindness of
      heart. The king seemed only pleased with every one present. Monsieur was
      the only one who did not understand anything about the matter. The ballet
      began; the effect was more than beautiful. When the music, by its bursts
      of melody, carried away these illustrious dancers, when the simple,
      untutored pantomime of that period, only the more natural on account of
      the very indifferent acting of the august actors, had reached its
      culminating point of triumph, the theater shook with tumultuous applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche shone like a sun, but like a courtly sun, that is resigned to
      fill a subordinate part. Disdainful of a success of which Madame showed no
      acknowledgement, he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the marked
      preference of the princess. She, however, did not bestow a single glance
      upon him. By degrees all his happiness, all his brilliancy, subsided into
      regret and uneasiness; so that his limbs lost their power, his arms hung
      heavily by his sides, and his head drooped as though he was stupefied. The
      king, who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in
      the quadrille, cast a look upon his vanquished rival. De Guiche soon
      ceased to sustain even the character of the courtier; without applause, he
      danced indifferently, and very soon could not dance at all, by which
      accident the triumph of the king and of Madame was assured.

    <h2>
      Chapter XL: The Nymphs of the Park of Fontainebleau.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king remained for a moment to enjoy a triumph as complete as it could
      possibly be. He then turned towards Madame, for the purpose of admiring
      her also a little in her turn. Young persons love with more vivacity,
      perhaps with greater ardor and deeper passion, than others more advanced
      in years; but all the other feelings are at the same time developed in
      proportion to their youth and vigor: so that vanity being with them almost
      always the equivalent of love, the latter feeling, according to the laws
      of equipoise, never attains that degree of perfection which it acquires in
      men and women from thirty to five and thirty years of age. Louis thought
      of Madame, but only after he had studiously thought of himself; and Madame
      carefully thought of herself, without bestowing a single thought upon the
      king. The victim, however, of all these royal affections and affectations,
      was poor De Guiche. Every one could observe his agitation and prostration&mdash;a
      prostration which was, indeed, the more remarkable since people were not
      accustomed to see him with his arms hanging listlessly by his side, his
      head bewildered, and his eyes with all their bright intelligence bedimmed.
      It rarely happened that any uneasiness was excited on his account,
      whenever a question of elegance or taste was under discussion; and De
      Guiche's defeat was accordingly attributed by the greater number present
      to his courtier-like tact and ability. But there were others&mdash;keen-sighted
      observers are always to be met with at court&mdash;who remarked his
      paleness and his altered looks; which he could neither feign nor conceal,
      and their conclusion was that De Guiche was not acting the part of a
      flatterer. All these sufferings, successes, and remarks were blended,
      confounded, and lost in the uproar of applause. When, however, the queens
      expressed their satisfaction and the spectators their enthusiasm, when the
      king had retired to his dressing-room to change his costume, and whilst
      Monsieur, dressed as a woman, as he delighted to be, was in his turn
      dancing about, De Guiche, who had now recovered himself, approached
      Madame, who, seated at the back of the theater, was waiting for the second
      part, and had quitted the others for the purpose of creating a sort of
      solitude for herself in the midst of the crowd, to meditate, as it were,
      beforehand, upon chorographic effects; and it will be perfectly understood
      that, absorbed in deep meditation, she did not see, or rather pretended
      not to notice, anything that was passing around her. De Guiche, observing
      that she was alone, near a thicket constructed of painted cloth,
      approached her. Two of her maids of honor, dressed as hamadryads, seeing
      De Guiche advance, drew back out of respect., whereupon De Guiche
      proceeded towards the middle of the circle and saluted her royal highness;
      but, whether she did or did not observe his salutations, the princess did
      not even turn her head. A cold shiver passed through poor De Guiche; he
      was unprepared for such utter indifference, for he had neither seen nor
      been told of anything that had taken place, and consequently could guess
      nothing. Remarking, therefore, that his obeisance obtained him no
      acknowledgement, he advanced one step further, and in a voice which he
      tried, though vainly, to render calm, said: "I have the honor to present
      my most humble respects to your royal highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this Madame deigned to turn her eyes languishingly towards the comte,
      observing. "Ah! M. de Guiche, is that you? good day!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The comte's patience almost forsook him, as he continued,&mdash;"Your
      royal highness danced just now most charmingly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think so?" she replied with indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect
      harmony with your own."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame again turned round, and, looking De Guiche full in the face with a
      bright and steady gaze, said,&mdash;"Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! there can be no doubt of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Explain yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You represented a divinity, beautiful, disdainful, inconstant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean Pomona, comte?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I allude to the goddess."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame remained silent for a moment, with her lips compressed, and then
      observed,&mdash;"But, comte, you, too, are an excellent dancer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, Madame, I am only one of those who are never noticed, or who are
      soon forgotten if they ever happen to be noticed."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this remark, accompanied by one of those deep sighs which affect the
      remotest fibers of one's being, his heart burdened with sorrow and
      throbbing fast, his head on fire, and his gaze wandering, he bowed
      breathlessly, and withdrew behind the thicket. The only reply Madame
      condescended to make was by slightly raising her shoulders, and, as her
      ladies of honor had discreetly retired while the conversation lasted, she
      recalled them by a look. The ladies were Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente
      and Mademoiselle de Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you hear what the Comte de Guiche said?" the princess inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It really is very singular," she continued, in a compassionate tone, "how
      exile has affected poor M. de Guiche's wit." And then, in a louder voice,
      fearful lest her unhappy victim might lose a syllable, she said,&mdash;"In
      the first place he danced badly, and afterwards his remarks were very
      silly."
    </p>
    <p>
      She then rose, humming the air to which she was presently going to dance.
      De Guiche had overheard everything. The arrow pierced his heart and
      wounded him mortally. Then, at the risk of interrupting the progress of
      the <i>fete</i> by his annoyance, he fled from the scene, tearing his
      beautiful costume of Autumn in pieces, and scattering, as he went along,
      the branches of vines, mulberry and almond trees, with all the other
      artificial attributes of his assumed divinity. A quarter of an hour
      afterwards he returned to the theater; but it will be readily believed
      that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement
      that enabled him to go back; or perhaps, for love is thus strangely
      constituted, he found it impossible even to remain much longer separated
      from the presence of one who had broken his heart. Madame was finishing
      her figure. She saw, but did not look at De Guiche, who, irritated and
      revengeful, turned his back upon her as she passed him, escorted by her
      nymphs, and followed by a hundred flatterers. During this time, at the
      other end of the theater, near the lake, a young woman was seated, with
      her eyes fixed upon one of the windows of the theater, from which were
      issuing streams of light&mdash;the window in question being that of the
      royal box. As De Guiche quitted the theater for the purpose of getting
      into the fresh air he so much needed, he passed close to this figure and
      saluted her. When she perceived the young man, she rose, like a woman
      surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from
      herself. De Guiche stopped as he recognized her, and said hurriedly,&mdash;"Good
      evening, Mademoiselle de la Valliere; I am indeed fortunate in meeting
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, also, M. de Guiche, am glad of this accidental meeting," said the
      young girl, as she was about to withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray do not leave me," said De Guiche, stretching out his hand towards
      her, "for you would be contradicting the kind words you have just
      pronounced. Remain, I implore you: the evening is most lovely. You wish to
      escape from the merry tumult, and prefer your own society. Well, I can
      understand it; all women who are possessed of any feeling do, and one
      never finds them dull or lonely when removed from the giddy vortex of
      these exciting amusements. Oh! Heaven!" he exclaimed, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter, monsieur le comte?" inquired La Valliere, with some
      anxiety. "You seem agitated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I! oh, no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you allow me, M. de Guiche, to return you the thanks I had proposed
      to offer you on the very first opportunity? It is to your recommendation,
      I am aware, that I owe my admission among the number of Madame's maids of
      honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! Ah! I remember now, and I congratulate myself. Do you love any
      one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I!" exclaimed La Valliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, I hardly know what I am saying; a thousand times forgive me;
      Madame was right, quite right, this brutal exile has completely turned my
      brain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet it seemed to me that the king received you with kindness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think so? Received me with kindness&mdash;perhaps so&mdash;yes&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There cannot be a doubt he received you kindly, for, in fact, you
      returned without his permission."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true, and I believe you are right. But have you not seen M. de
      Bragelonne here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere started at the name. "Why do you ask?" she inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have I offended you again?" said De Guiche. "In that case I am indeed
      unhappy, and greatly to be pitied."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, very unhappy, and very much to be pitied, Monsieur de Guiche, for
      you seem to be suffering terribly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! mademoiselle, why have I not a devoted sister, or a true friend, such
      as yourself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have friends, Monsieur de Guiche, and the Vicomte de Bragelonne, of
      whom you spoke just now, is, I believe, one of the most devoted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, you are right, he is one of my best friends. Farewell,
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere, farewell." And he fled, like one possessed,
      along the banks of the lake. His dark shadow glided, lengthening as it
      disappeared, among the illumined yews and glittering undulations of the
      water. La Valliere looked after him, saying,&mdash;"Yes, yes, he, too, is
      suffering, and I begin to understand why."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had hardly finished when her companions, Mademoiselle de Montalais and
      Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, ran forward. They were released from
      their attendance, and had changed their costumes of nymphs; delighted with
      the beautiful night, and the success of the evening, they returned to look
      after their companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, already here!" they said to her. "We thought we should be first at
      the rendezvous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been here this quarter of an hour," replied La Valliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did not the dancing amuse you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely the enchanting spectacle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more than the dancing. As far as beauty is concerned, I much prefer
      that which these dark woods present, in whose depths can be seen, now in
      one direction and again in another, a light passing by, as though it were
      an eye, in color like a midnight rainbow, sometimes open, at others
      closed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "La Valliere is quite a poetess," said Tonnay-Charente.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In other words," said Montalais, "she is insupportable. Whenever there is
      a question of laughing a little or of amusing ourselves, La Valliere
      begins to cry; whenever we girls have reason to cry, because, perhaps, we
      have mislaid our dresses, or because our vanity as been wounded, or our
      costume fails to produce an effect, La Valliere laughs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As far as I am concerned, that is not my character," said Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente. "I am a woman; and there are few like me; whoever loves
      me, flatters me; whoever flatters me, pleases me; and whoever pleases&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" said Montalais, "you do not finish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is too difficult," replied Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, laughing
      loudly. "Do you, who are so clever, finish for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you, Louise?" said Montalais, "does any one please you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a matter that concerns no one but myself," replied the young
      girl, rising from the mossy bank on which she had been reclining during
      the whole time the ballet lasted. "Now, mesdemoiselles, we have agreed to
      amuse ourselves to-night without any one to overlook us, and without any
      escort. We are three in number, we like one another, and the night is
      lovely. Look yonder, do you not see the moon slowly rising, silvering the
      topmost branches of the chestnuts and the oaks. Oh, beautiful walk! sweet
      liberty! exquisite soft turf of the woods, the happiness which your
      friendship confers upon me! let us walk arm in arm towards those large
      trees. Out yonder all are at this moment seated at table and fully
      occupied, or preparing to adorn themselves for a set and formal promenade;
      horses are being saddled, or harnessed to the carriages&mdash;the queen's
      mules or Madame's four white ponies. As for ourselves, we shall soon reach
      some retired spot where no eyes can see us and no step follow ours. Do you
      not remember, Montalais, the woods of Cheverny and of Chambord, the
      innumerable rustling poplars of Blois, where we exchanged our mutual
      hopes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And confidences too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, "I also think a good deal;
      but I take care&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To say nothing," said Montalais, "so that when Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente thinks, Athenais is the only one who knows it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" said Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, "I hear steps approaching
      from this side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quick, quick, then, among the high reed-grass," said Montalais; "stoop,
      Athenais, you are so tall."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente stooped as she was told, and, almost at
      the same moment, they saw two gentlemen approaching, their heads bent
      down, walking arm in arm, on the fine gravel walk running parallel with
      the bank. The young girls had, indeed, made themselves small&mdash;indeed
      invisible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Monsieur de Guiche," whispered Montalais in Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Monsieur de Bragelonne," whispered the latter to La Valliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two young men approached still closer, conversing in animated tones.
      "She was here just now," said the count. "If I had only seen her, I should
      have declared it to be a vision, but I spoke to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are positive, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but perhaps I frightened her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I was still half crazy at you know what; so that she could hardly
      have understood what I was saying, and must have grown alarmed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Bragelonne, "do not make yourself uneasy: she is all kindness,
      and will excuse you; she is clear-sighted, and will understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but if she should have understood, and understood too well, she may
      talk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not know Louise, count," said Raoul. "Louise possesses every
      virtue, and has not a single fault." And the two young men passed on, and,
      as they proceeded, their voices were soon lost in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is it, La Valliere," said Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, "that the
      Vicomte de Bragelonne spoke of you as Louise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were brought up together," replied Louise, blushing; "M. de Bragelonne
      has honored me by asking my hand in marriage, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems the king will not consent to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh! Why the king? and what has the king to do with it?" exclaimed Aure,
      sharply. "Good gracious! has the king any right to interfere in matters of
      that kind? Politics are politics, as M. de Mazarin used to say; but love
      is love. If, therefore, you love M. de Bragelonne, marry him. <i>I</i>
      give <i>my</i> consent."
    </p>
    <p>
      Athenais began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I am speaking seriously," replied Montalais, "and my opinion in this
      case is quite as good as the king's, I suppose; is it not, Louise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come," said La Valliere, "these gentlemen have passed; let us take
      advantage of our being alone to cross the open ground and so take refuge
      in the woods."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the better," said Athenais, "because I see the torches setting
      out from the chateau and the theater, and they seem as if they were
      preceding some person of distinction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us run, then," said all three. And, gracefully lifting up the long
      skirts of their silk dresses, they lightly ran across the open space
      between the lake and the thickest covert of the park. Montalais agile as a
      deer, Athenais eager as a young wolf, bounded through the dry grass, and,
      now and then, some bold Acteon might, by the aid of the faint light, have
      perceived their straight and well-formed limbs somewhat displayed beneath
      the heavy folds of their satin petticoats. La Valliere, more refined and
      more bashful, allowed her dress to flow around her; retarded also by the
      lameness of her foot, it was not long before she called out to her
      companions to halt, and, left behind, she obliged them both to wait for
      her. At this moment, a man, concealed in a dry ditch planted with young
      willow saplings, scrambled quickly up its shelving side, and ran off in
      the direction of the chateau. The three young girls, on their side,
      reached the outskirts of the park, every path of which they well knew. The
      ditches were bordered by high hedges full of flowers, which on that side
      protected the foot-passengers from being intruded upon by the horses and
      carriages. In fact, the sound of Madame's and the queen's carriages could
      be heard in the distance upon the hard dry ground of the roads, followed
      by the mounted cavaliers. Distant music reached them in response, and when
      the soft notes died away, the nightingale, with throat of pride, poured
      forth his melodious chants, and his most complicated, learned, and
      sweetest compositions to those who had met beneath the thick covert of the
      woods. Near the songster, in the dark background of the large trees, could
      be seen the glistening eyes of an owl, attracted by the harmony. In this
      way the <i>fete</i> of the whole court was a <i>fete</i> also for the
      mysterious inhabitants of the forest; for certainly the deer in the brake,
      the pheasant on the branch, the fox in its hole, were all listening. One
      could realize the life led by this nocturnal and invisible population from
      the restless movements that suddenly took place among the leaves. Our
      sylvan nymphs uttered a slight cry, but, reassured immediately afterwards,
      they laughed, and resumed their walk. In this manner they reached the
      royal oak, the venerable relic of a tree which in its prime has listened
      to the sighs of Henry II. for the beautiful Diana of Poitiers, and later
      still to those of Henry IV. for the lovely Gabrielle d'Estrees. Beneath
      this oak the gardeners had piled up the moss and turf in such a manner
      that never had a seat more luxuriously rested the wearied limbs of man or
      monarch. The trunk, somewhat rough to recline against, was sufficiently
      large to accommodate the three young girls, whose voices were lost among
      the branches, which stretched upwards to the sky.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLI. What Was Said under the Royal Oak.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The softness of the air, the stillness of the foliage, tacitly imposed
      upon these young girls an engagement to change immediately their giddy
      conversation for one of a more serious character. She, indeed, whose
      disposition was the most lively,&mdash;Montalais, for instance,&mdash;was
      the first to yield to the influence; and she began by heaving a deep sigh,
      and saying:&mdash;"What happiness to be here alone, and at liberty, with
      every right to be frank, especially towards one another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente; "for the court, however
      brilliant it may be, has always some falsehood concealed beneath the folds
      of its velvet robes, or the glitter of its diamonds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I," replied La Valliere, "I never tell a falsehood; when I cannot speak
      the truth, I remain silent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not long remain in favor," said Montalais; "it is not here as it
      was at Blois, where we told the dowager Madame all our little annoyances,
      and all our longings. There were certain days when Madame remembered that
      she herself had been young, and, on those days, whoever talked with her
      found in her a sincere friend. She related to us her flirtations with
      Monsieur, and we told her of the flirtations she had had with others, or,
      at least, the rumors of them that had spread abroad. Poor woman, so
      simple-minded! she laughed at them, as we did. Where is she now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Montalais,&mdash;laughter-loving Montalais!" cried La Valliere; "you
      see you are sighing again; the woods inspire you, and you are almost
      reasonable this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought not, either of you," said Athenais, "to regret the court at
      Blois so much, unless you do not feel happy with us. A court is a place
      where men and women resort to talk of matters which mothers, guardians,
      and especially confessors, severely denounce."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Athenais!" said Louise, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Athenais is frank to-night," said Montalais; "let us avail ourselves of
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, let us take advantage of it, for this evening I could divulge the
      softest secrets of my heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, if M. Montespan were here!" said Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think that I care for M. de Montespan?" murmured the beautiful
      young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is handsome, I believe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. And that is no small advantage in my eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There now, you see&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go further, and say, that of all the men whom one sees here, he is
      the handsomest, and the most&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was that?" said La Valliere, starting suddenly from the mossy bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A deer hurrying by, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am only afraid of men," said Athenais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When they do not resemble M. de Montespan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A truce to raillery. M. de Montespan is attentive to me, but that does
      not commit me in any way. Is not M. de Guiche here, he who is so devoted
      to Madame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor fellow!" said La Valliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why to be pitied? Madame is sufficiently beautiful, and of high enough
      rank, I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere shook her head sorrowfully, saying, "When one loves, it is
      neither beauty nor rank;&mdash;when one loves it should be the heart, or
      the eyes only, of him, or of her whom one loves."
    </p>
    <p>
      Montalais began to laugh loudly. "Heart, eyes," she said; "oh,
      sugar-plums!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I speak for myself;" replied La Valliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Noble sentiments," said Athenais, with an air of protection, but with
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are they not your own?" asked Louise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly so; but to continue: how can one pity a man who bestows his
      attentions upon such a woman as Madame? If any disproportion exists, it is
      on the count's side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! no, no," returned La Valliere; "it is on Madame's side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Explain yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will. Madame has not even a wish to know what love is. She diverts
      herself with the feeling, as children do with fireworks, form which a
      spark might set a palace on fire. It makes a display, and that is all she
      cares about. Besides, pleasure forms the tissue of which she wishes her
      life to be woven. M. de Guiche loves this illustrious personage, but she
      will never love him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Athenais laughed disdainfully. "Do people really ever love?" she said.
      "Where are the noble sentiments you just now uttered? Does not a woman's
      virtue consist in the uncompromising refusal of every intrigue that might
      compromise her? A properly regulated woman, endowed with a natural heart,
      ought to look at men, make herself loved&mdash;adored, even, by them, and
      say at the very utmost but once in her life, 'I begin to think that I
      ought not to have been what I am,&mdash;I should have detested this one
      less than others.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therefore," exclaimed La Valliere, "that is what M. de Montespan has to
      expect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly; he, as well as every one else. What! have I not said that I
      admit he possesses a certain superiority, and would not that be enough? My
      dear child, a woman is a queen during the entire period nature permits her
      to enjoy sovereign power&mdash;from fifteen to thirty-five years of age.
      After that, we are free to have a heart, when we only have that left&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, oh!" murmured La Valliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent," cried Montalais; "a very masterly woman; Athenais, you will
      make your way in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not approve of what I say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Completely," replied her laughing companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are not serious, Montalais?" said Louise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes; I approve everything Athenais has just said; only&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only <i>what?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I cannot carry it out. I have the firmest principles; I form
      resolutions beside which the laws of the Stadtholder and of the King of
      Spain are child's play; but when the moment arrives to put them into
      execution, nothing comes of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your courage fails?" said Athenais, scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Miserably so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Great weakness of nature," returned Athenais. "But at least you make a
      choice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, no. It pleases fate to disappoint me in everything; I dream of
      emperors, and I find only&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aure, Aure!" exclaimed La Valliere, "for pity's sake, do not, for the
      pleasure of saying something witty, sacrifice those who love you with such
      devoted affection."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I do not trouble myself much about that; those who love me are
      sufficiently happy that I do not dismiss them altogether. So much the
      worse for myself if I have a weakness for any one, but so much the worse
      for others if I revenge myself upon them for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," said Athenais, "and, perhaps, you too will reach the
      goal. In other words, young ladies, that is termed being a coquette. Men,
      who are very silly in most things, are particularly so in confounding,
      under the term of coquetry, a woman's pride, and love of changing her
      sentiments as she does her dress. I, for instance, am proud; that is to
      say, impregnable. I treat my admirers harshly, but without any pretention
      to retain them. Men call me a coquette, because they are vain enough to
      think I care for them. Other women&mdash;Montalais, for instance&mdash;have
      allowed themselves to be influenced by flattery; they would be lost were
      it not for that most fortunate principle of instinct which urges them to
      change suddenly, and punish the man whose devotion they so recently
      accepted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very learned dissertation," said Montalais, in the tone of thorough
      enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is odious!" murmured Louise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks to that sort of coquetry, for, indeed, that is genuine coquetry,"
      continued Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente; "the lover who, a little while
      since, was puffed up with pride, in a minute afterwards is suffering at
      every pore of his vanity and self-esteem. He was, perhaps, already
      beginning to assume the airs of a conqueror, but now he retreats defeated;
      he was about to assume an air of protection towards us, but he is obliged
      to prostrate himself once more. The result of all this is, that, instead
      of having a husband who is jealous and troublesome, free from restraint in
      his conduct towards us, we have a lover always trembling in our presence,
      always fascinated by our attractions, always submissive; and for this
      simple reason, that he finds the same woman never twice of the same mind.
      Be convinced, therefore, of the advantages of coquetry. Possessing that,
      one reigns a queen among women in cases where Providence has withheld that
      precious faculty of holding one's heart and mind in check."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How clever you are," said Montalais, "and how well you understand the
      duty women owe themselves!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am only settling a case of individual happiness," said Athenais
      modestly; "and defending myself, like all weak, loving dispositions,
      against the oppressions of the stronger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "La Valliere does not say a word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does she not approve of what we are saying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay; only I do not understand it," said Louise. "You talk like people not
      called upon to live in this world of ours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And very pretty your world is," said Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A world," returned Athenais, "in which men worship a woman until she has
      fallen,&mdash;and insult her when she has fallen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who spoke to you of falling?" said Louise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours is a new theory, then; will you tell us how you intend to resist
      yielding to temptation, if you allow yourself to be hurried away by
      feelings of affection?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" exclaimed the young girl, raising towards the dark heavens her
      beautiful large eyes filled with tears, "if you did but know what a heart
      is, I would explain, and convince you; a loving heart is stronger than all
      your coquetry, more powerful than all your pride. A woman is never truly
      loved, I believe; a man never loves with idolatry, unless he feels sure he
      is loved in return. Let old men, whom we read of in comedies, fancy
      themselves adored by coquettes. A young man is conscious of, and knows
      them; if he has a fancy, or a strong desire, and an absorbing passion, for
      a coquette, he cannot mistake her; a coquette may drive him out of his
      senses, but will never make him fall in love. Love, such as I conceive it
      to be, is an incessant, complete, and perfect sacrifice; but it is not the
      sacrifice of one only of the two persons thus united. It is the perfect
      abnegation of two who are desirous of blending their beings into one. If
      ever I love, I shall implore my lover to leave me free and pure; I will
      tell him, and he will understand, that my heart was torn by my refusal,
      and he, in his love for me, aware of the magnitude of my sacrifice,&mdash;he,
      in his turn, I say, will store his devotion for me,&mdash;will respect me,
      and will not seek my ruin, to insult me when I shall have fallen, as you
      said just now, whilst uttering your blasphemies against love, such as I
      understand it. That is my idea of love. And now you will tell me, perhaps,
      that my love will despise me; I defy him to do so, unless he be the vilest
      of men, and my heart assures me that it is not such a man I would choose.
      A look from me will repay him for the sacrifices he makes, or will inspire
      him with the virtues which he would never think he possessed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Louise," exclaimed Montalais, "you tell us this, and do not carry it
      into practice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are adored by Raoul de Bragelonne, who worships you on both knees.
      The poor fellow is made the victim of your virtue, just as he would be&mdash;
      nay, more than he would be, even&mdash;of my coquetry, or Athenais's
      pride."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All this is simply a different shade of coquetry," said Athenais; "and
      Louise, I perceive, is a coquette without knowing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said La Valliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you may call it instinct, if you please, keenest sensibility,
      exquisite refinement of feeling, perpetual play of restrained outbreaks of
      affection, which end in smoke. It is very artful too, and very effective.
      I should even, now that I reflect upon it, have preferred this system of
      tactics to my own pride, for waging war on members of the other sex,
      because it offers the advantage sometimes of thoroughly convincing them;
      but, at the present moment, without utterly condemning myself, I declare
      it to be superior to the non-complex coquetry of Montalais." And the two
      young girls began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere alone preserved silence, and quietly shook her head. Then, a
      moment after, she added, "If you were to tell me, in the presence of a
      man, but a fourth part of what you have just said, or even if I were
      assured that you think it, I should die of shame and grief where I am
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; die, poor tender little darling," replied Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente; "for if there are no men here, there are at least two
      women, your own friends, who declare you to be attained and convicted of
      being a coquette from instinct; in other words, the most dangerous kind of
      coquette the world possesses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! mesdemoiselles," replied La Valliere, blushing, and almost ready to
      weep. Her two companions again burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well! I will ask Bragelonne to tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bragelonne?" said Athenais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! Bragelonne, who is as courageous as Caesar, and as clever and witty
      as M. Fouquet. Poor fellow! for twelve years he has known you, loved you,
      and yet&mdash;one can hardly believe it&mdash;he has never even kissed the
      tips of your fingers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell us the reason of this cruelty, you who are all heart," said Athenais
      to La Valliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me explain it by a single word&mdash;virtue. You will perhaps deny
      the existence of virtue?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, Louise, tell us the truth," said Aure, taking her by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you wish me to tell you?" cried La Valliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever you like; but it will be useless for you to say anything, for I
      persist in my opinion of you. A coquette from instinct; in other words, as
      I have already said, and I say it again, the most dangerous of all
      coquettes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! no, no; for pity's sake do not believe that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! twelve years of extreme severity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can that be, since twelve years ago I was only five years old? The
      frivolity of the child cannot surely be placed to the young girl's
      account."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! you are now seventeen; three years instead of twelve. During those
      three years you have remained constantly and unchangeably cruel. Against
      you are arrayed the silent shades of Blois, the meetings when you
      diligently conned the stars together, the evening wanderings beneath the
      plantain-trees, his impassioned twenty years speaking to your fourteen
      summers, the fire of his glances addressed to yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes; but so it is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why impossible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell us something credible and we will believe you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet, if you were to suppose one thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose that I thought I was in love, and that I am not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! not in love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then! if I have acted in a different manner to what others do when
      they are in love, it is because I do not love; and because my hour has not
      yet come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Louise, Louise," said Montalais, "take care or I will remind you of the
      remark you made just now. Raoul is not here; do not overwhelm him while he
      is absent; be charitable, and if, on closer inspection, you think you do
      not love him, tell him so, poor fellow!" and she began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Louise pitied M. de Guiche just now," said Athenais; "would it be
      possible to detect an explanation of her indifference for the one in this
      compassion for the other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say what you please," said La Valliere, sadly; "upbraid me as you like,
      since you do not understand me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! oh!" replied Montalais, "temper, sorrow, tears; we are jesting,
      Louise, and are not, I assure you, quite the monsters you suppose. Look at
      the proud Athenais, as she is called; she does not love M. de Montespan,
      it is true, but she would be in despair if M. de Montespan did not
      continue to love her. Look at me; I laugh at M. Malicorne, but the poor
      fellow whom I laugh at knows precisely when he will be permitted to press
      his lips upon my hand. And yet the eldest of us is not twenty yet. What a
      future before us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silly, silly girls!" murmured Louise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite right," said Montalais; "and you alone have spoken words of
      wisdom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not dispute it," replied Athenais. "And so it is clear you do not
      love poor M. de Bragelonne?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps she does," said Montalais; "she is not yet quite certain of it.
      But, in any case, listen, Athenais; if M. de Bragelonne is ever free, I
      will give you a little friendly advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To look at him well before you decide in favor of M. de Montespan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! in that way of considering the subject, M. de Bragelonne is not the
      only one whom one could look at with pleasure; M. de Guiche, for instance,
      has his value also."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He did not distinguish himself this evening," said Montalais; "and I know
      from very good authority that Madame thought him insupportable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Saint-Aignan produced a most brilliant effect, and I am sure that
      more than one person who saw him dance this evening will not soon forget
      him. Do you not think so, La Valliere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you ask me? I did not see him, nor do I know him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! you did not see M. de Saint-Aignan? Don't you know him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, do not affect a virtue more extravagantly excessive than our
      vanity!&mdash;you have eyes, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you must have seen all those who danced this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, nearly all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a very impertinent 'nearly all' for somebody."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must take it for what it is worth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; now, among all those gentlemen whom you saw, which do you
      prefer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Montalais, "is it M. de Saint-Aignan, or M. de Guiche, or M.&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I prefer no one; I thought them all about the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean, then, that among that brilliant assembly, the first court in
      the world, no one pleased you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not say that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell us, then, who your ideal is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not an ideal being."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He exists, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In very truth," exclaimed La Valliere, aroused and excited; "I cannot
      understand you at all. What! you who have a heart as I have, eyes as I
      have, and yet you speak of M. de Guiche, of M. de Saint-Aignan, when the
      king was there." These words, uttered in a precipitate manner, and in an
      agitated, fervid tone of voice, made her two companions, between whom she
      was seated, exclaim in a manner that terrified her, "<i>The king!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere buried her face in her hands. "Yes," she murmured; "the king!
      the king! Have you ever seen any one to be compared to the king?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were right just now in saying you had excellent eyes, Louise, for you
      see a great distance; too far, indeed. Alas! the king is not one upon whom
      our poor eyes have a right to hinge themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is too true," cried La Valliere; "it is not the privilege of all
      eyes to gaze upon the sun; but I will look upon him, even were I to be
      blinded in doing so." At this moment, and as though caused by the words
      which had just escaped La Valliere's lips, a rustling of leaves, and of
      what sounded like some silken material, was heard behind the adjoining
      bushes. The young girls hastily rose, almost terrified out of their
      senses. They distinctly saw the leaves move, without being able to see
      what it was that stirred them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a wolf or a wild boar," cried Montalais; "fly! fly!" The three
      girls, in the extremity of terror, fled by the first path that presented
      itself, and did not stop until they had reached the verge of the wood.
      There, breathless, leaning against each other, feeling their hearts throb
      wildly, they endeavored to collect their senses, but could only succeed in
      doing so after the lapse of some minutes. Perceiving at last the lights
      from the windows of the chateau, they decided to walk towards them. La
      Valliere was exhausted with fatigue, and Aure and Athenais were obliged to
      support her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have escaped well," said Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am greatly afraid," said La Valliere, "that it was something worse than
      a wolf. For my part, and I speak as I think, I should have preferred to
      have run the risk of being devoured alive by some wild animal than to have
      been listened to and overheard. Fool, fool that I am! How could I have
      thought, how could I have said what I did?" And saying this her head bowed
      like the water tossed plume of a bulrush; she felt her limbs fail, and her
      strength abandoning her, and, gliding almost inanimate from the arms of
      her companions, sank down upon the turf.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLII. The King's Uneasiness.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Let us leave poor La Valliere, who had fainted in the arms of her two
      companions, and return to the precincts of the royal oak. The young girls
      had hardly run twenty paces, when the sound which had so much alarmed them
      was renewed among the branches. A man's figure might indistinctly be
      perceived, and putting the branches of the bushes aside, he appeared upon
      the verge of the wood, and perceiving that the place was empty, burst out
      into a peal of laughter. It is almost superfluous to add that the form in
      question was that of a young and handsome cavalier, who immediately made a
      sign to another, who thereupon made his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, sire," said the second figure, advancing timidly, "has your majesty
      put our young sentimentalists to flight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems so," said the king, "and you can show yourself without fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, sire, you will be recognized."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I tell you they are flown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a most fortunate meeting, sire; and, if I dared offer an opinion
      to your majesty, we ought to follow them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are far enough away by this time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They would quickly allow themselves to be overtaken, especially if they
      knew who were following them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by that, coxcomb that you are?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, one of them seems to have taken a fancy to me, and another compared
      you to the sun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The greater reason why we should not show ourselves, Saint-Aignan. The
      sun never shows itself in the night-time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word, sire, your majesty seems to have very little curiosity. In
      your place, I should like to know who are the two nymphs, the two dryads,
      the two hamadryads, who have so good an opinion of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall know them again very well, I assure you, without running after
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By what means?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By their voices, of course. They belong to the court, and the one who
      spoke of me had a remarkably sweet voice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! your majesty permits yourself to be influenced by flattery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one will ever say it is a means <i>you</i> make use of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive my stupidity, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come; let us go and look where I told you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the passion, then, which your majesty confided to me, already
      forgotten?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! no, indeed. How is it possible to forget such beautiful eyes as
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere has?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet the other one has a beautiful voice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lady who has fallen in love with the sun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Saint-Aignan!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I am not sorry you should believe me to be an admirer of sweet
      voices as well as of beautiful eyes. I know you to be a terrible talker,
      and to-morrow I shall have to pay for the confidence I have shown you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That to-morrow every one will know that I have designs upon this little
      La Valliere; but be careful, Saint-Aignan, I have confided my secret to no
      one but you, and if any one should speak to me about it, I shall know who
      has betrayed my secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are angry, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but you understand I do not wish to compromise the poor girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not be afraid, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You promise me, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give you my word of honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent," thought the king, laughing to himself; "now every one will
      know to-morrow that I have been running about after La Valliere to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, endeavoring to see where he was, he said: "Why we have lost
      ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite so bad as that, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where does that gate lead to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Rond-Point, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where were we going when we heard the sound of women's voices?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire, and the termination of a conversation in which I had the honor
      of hearing my own name pronounced by the side of your majesty's."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You return to that subject too frequently, Saint-Aignan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty will forgive me, but I am delighted to know that a woman
      exists whose thoughts are occupied about me, without my knowledge, and
      without my having done anything to deserve it. Your majesty cannot
      comprehend this satisfaction, for your rank and merit attract attention,
      and compel regard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, Saint-Aignan, believe me or not, as you like," said the king,
      leaning familiarly upon Saint-Aignan's arm and taking the path he thought
      would lead them to the chateau; "but this candid confession, this
      perfectly disinterested preference of one who will, perhaps, never attract
      my attention&mdash;in one word, the mystery of this adventure excites me,
      and the truth is, that if I were not so taken with La Valliere&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not let that interfere with your majesty's intentions: you have time
      enough before you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "La Valliere is said to be very strict in her ideas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You excite my curiosity and I am anxious to see her again. Come, let us
      walk on."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king spoke untruly, for nothing, on the contrary, could make him less
      anxious, but he had a part to play, and so he walked on hurriedly.
      Saint-Aignan followed him at a short distance. Suddenly the king stopped;
      the courtier followed his example.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saint-Aignan," he said, "do you not hear some one moaning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire, and weeping, too, it seems."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is in this direction," said the king. "It sounds like the tears and
      sobs of a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run," said the king; and, following a by-path, they ran across the grass.
      As they approached, the cries were more distinctly heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help, help," exclaimed two voices. The king and his companion redoubled
      their speed, and, as they approached nearer, the sighs they had heard were
      changed into loud sobs. The cry of "Help! help!" was again repeated; at
      the sound of which, the king and Saint-Aignan increased the rapidity of
      their pace. Suddenly at the other side of a ditch, under the branches of a
      willow, they perceived a woman on her knees, holding another in her arms
      who seemed to have fainted. A few paces from them, a third, standing in
      the middle of the path, was calling for assistance. Perceiving the two
      gentlemen, whose rank she could not tell, her cries for assistance were
      redoubled. The king, who was in advance of his companion, leaped across
      the ditch, and reached the group at the very moment when, from the end of
      the path which led to the chateau, a dozen persons were approaching, who
      had been drawn to the spot by the same cries that had attracted the
      attention of the king and M. de Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter, young ladies?" said Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king!" exclaimed Mademoiselle de Montalais, in her astonishment,
      letting La Valliere's head fall upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is the king; but that is no reason why you should abandon your
      companion. Who is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is Mademoiselle de la Valliere, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle de la Valliere!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire, she has just fainted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor child!" said the king. "Quick, quick, fetch a surgeon." But however
      great the anxiety with which the king had pronounced these words may have
      seemed to others, he had not so carefully schooled himself but that they
      appeared, as well as the gesture which accompanied them, somewhat cold to
      Saint-Aignan, to whom the king had confided the sudden love with which she
      had inspired him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saint-Aignan," continued the king, "watch over Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere, I beg. Send for a surgeon. I will hasten forward and inform
      Madame of the accident which has befallen one of her maids of honor." And,
      in fact, while M. de Saint-Aignan was busily engaged in making
      preparations for carrying Mademoiselle de la Valliere to the chateau, the
      king hurried forward, happy to have an opportunity of approaching Madame,
      and of speaking to her under a colorable pretext. Fortunately, a carriage
      was passing; the coachman was told to stop, and the persons who were
      inside, having been informed of the accident, eagerly gave up their seats
      to Mademoiselle de la Valliere. The current of fresh air produced by the
      rapid motion of the carriage soon recalled her to her senses. Having
      reached the chateau, she was able, though very weak, to alight from the
      carriage, and, with the assistance of Athenais and of Montalais, to reach
      the inner apartments. They made her sit down in one of the rooms of the
      ground floor. After a while, as the accident had not produced much effect
      upon those who had been walking, the promenade was resumed. During this
      time, the king had found Madame beneath a tree with overhanging branches,
      and had seated himself by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, sire," said Henrietta to him, in a low tone, "you do not show
      yourself as indifferent as you ought to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" replied the king, in the same tone, "I much fear we have entered
      into an agreement above our strength to keep." He then added aloud, "You
      have heard of the accident, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What accident?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! in seeing you I forgot I hurried here expressly to tell you of it. I
      am, however, painfully affected by it; one of your maids of honor,
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere, has just fainted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! poor girl," said the princess, quietly, "what was the cause of
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She then added in an undertone, "You forget, sire, that you wish others to
      believe in your passion for this girl, and yet you remain here while she
      is almost dying, perhaps, elsewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Madame," said the king, sighing, "how much more perfect you are in
      your part than I am, and how actively you think of everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then rose, saying loud enough for every one to hear him, "Permit me to
      leave you, Madame; my uneasiness is very great, and I wish to be quite
      certain, myself, that proper attention has been given to Mademoiselle de
      la Valliere." And the king left again to return to La Valliere, while
      those who had been present commented upon the king's remark:&mdash;"My
      uneasiness is very great."

      Chapter XLIII. The King's Secret.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On his way Louis met the Comte de Saint-Aignan. "Well, Saint-Aignan," he
      inquired, with affected interest, "how is the invalid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, sire," stammered Saint-Aignan, "to my shame, I confess I do not
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! you do not know?" said the king, pretending to take in a serious
      manner this want of attention for the object of his predilection.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will your majesty pardon me; but I have just met one of our three
      loquacious wood-nymphs, and I confess that my attention has been taken
      away from other matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said the king, eagerly, "you have found, then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The one who deigned to speak of me in such advantageous terms; and,
      having found mine, I was searching for yours, sire, when I had the
      happiness to meet your majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; but Mademoiselle de la Valliere before everything else," said
      the king, faithful to the character he had assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! our charming invalid!" said Saint-Aignan; "how fortunately her
      fainting fit came on, since your majesty had already occupied yourself
      about her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the name of your fair lady, Saint-Aignan? Is it a secret?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It ought to be a secret, and a very great one, even; but your majesty is
      well aware that no secret can possibly exist for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what is her name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she pretty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exceedingly, sire; and I recognized the voice which pronounced my name in
      such tender accents. I accosted her, questioned her as well as I was able
      to do, in the midst of the crowd; and she told me, without suspecting
      anything, that a little while ago she was under the great oak, with her
      two friends, when the sound of a wolf or a robber had terrified them, and
      made them run away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," inquired the king, anxiously, "what are the names of these two
      friends?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire," said Saint-Aignan, "will your majesty send me forthwith to the
      Bastile?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I am an egotist and a fool. My surprise was so great at such a
      conquest, and at so fortunate a discovery, that I went no further in my
      inquiries. Besides, I did not think that your majesty would attach any
      very great importance to what you heard, knowing how much your attention
      was taken up by Mademoiselle de la Valliere; and then, Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente left me precipitately, to return to Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us hope, then, that I shall be as fortunate as yourself. Come,
      Saint-Aignan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty is ambitions, I perceive, and does not wish to allow any
      conquest to escape you. Well, I assure you that I will conscientiously set
      about my inquiries; and, moreover, from one or the other of those Three
      Graces we shall learn the names of the rest, and by the names their
      secrets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, too," said the king, "only require to hear her voice to know it again.
      Come, let us say no more about it, but show me where poor La Valliere is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," thought Saint-Aignan, "the king's regard is beginning to display
      itself, and for that girl too. It is extraordinary; I should never have
      believed it." And with this thought passing through his mind, he showed
      the king the room to which La Valliere had been carried; the king entered,
      followed by Saint-Aignan. In a low chamber, near a large window looking
      out upon the gardens, La Valliere, reclining in a large armchair, was
      inhaling deep draughts of the perfumed evening breeze. From the loosened
      body of her dress, the lace fell in tumbled folds, mingling with the
      tresses of her beautiful fair hair, which lay scattered upon her
      shoulders. Her languishing eyes were filled with tears; she seemed as
      lifeless as those beautiful visions of our dreams, that pass before the
      mental eye of the sleeper, half-opening their wings without moving them,
      unclosing their lips without a sound escaping them. The pearl-like pallor
      of La Valliere possessed a charm it would be impossible to describe.
      Mental and bodily suffering had produced upon her features a soft and
      noble expression of grief; from the perfect passiveness of her arms and
      bust, she more resembled one whose soul had passed away, than a living
      being; she seemed not to hear either of the whisperings which arose from
      the court. She seemed to be communing within herself; and her beautiful,
      delicate hands trembled from time to time as though at the contact of some
      invisible touch. She was so completely absorbed in her reverie, that the
      king entered without her perceiving him. At a distance he gazed upon her
      lovely face, upon which the moon shed its pure silvery light.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good Heavens!" he exclaimed, with a terror he could not control, "she is
      dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sire," said Montalais, in a low voice; "on the contrary, she is
      better. Are you not better, Louise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Louise did not answer. "Louise," continued Montalais, "the king has
      deigned to express his uneasiness on your account."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king!" exclaimed Louise, starting up abruptly, as if a stream of fire
      had started through her frame to her heart; "the king uneasy about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king is here, then?" said La Valliere, not venturing to look round
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That voice! that voice!" whispered Louis, eagerly, to Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is so," replied Saint-Aignan; "your majesty is right; it is she
      who declared her love for the sun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" said the king. And then approaching La Valliere, he said, "You are
      not well, Mademoiselle de la Valliere? Just now, indeed, in the park, I
      saw that you had fainted. How were you attacked?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire," stammered out the poor child, pale and trembling, "I really do not
      know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been walking too far," said the king; "and fatigue, perhaps&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sire," said Montalais, eagerly, answering for her friend, "it could
      not be from fatigue, for we passed most of the evening seated beneath the
      royal oak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Under the royal oak?" returned the king, starting. "I was not deceived;
      it is as I thought." And he directed a look of intelligence at the comte.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Saint-Aignan, "under the royal oak, with Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know that?" inquired Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a very simple way. Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente told me so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, she probably told you the cause of Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere's fainting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes; she told me something about a wolf or a robber. I forget
      precisely which." La Valliere listened, her eyes fixed, her bosom heaving,
      as if, gifted with an acuteness of perception, she foresaw a portion of
      the truth. Louis imagined this attitude and agitation to be the
      consequence of a terror only partially reassured. "Nay, fear nothing," he
      said, with a rising emotion which he could not conceal; "the wolf which
      terrified you so much was simply a wolf with two legs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a man, then!" said Louise; "it was a man who was listening?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose it was so, mademoiselle, what great harm was there in his having
      listened? Is it likely that, even in your own opinion, you would have said
      anything which could not have been listened to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere wrung her hands, and hid her face in them, as if to hide her
      blushes. "In Heaven's name," she said, "who was concealed there? Who was
      listening?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The king advanced towards her, to take hold of one of her hands. "It was
      I," he said, bowing with marked respect. "Is it likely I could have
      frightened you?" La Valliere uttered a loud cry; for the second time her
      strength forsook her; and moaning in utter despair, she again fell
      lifeless in her chair. The king had just time to hold out his arm; so that
      she was partially supported by him. Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente and
      Montalais, who stood a few paces from the king and La Valliere, motionless
      and almost petrified at the recollection of their conversation with La
      Valliere, did not even think of offering their assistance, feeling
      restrained by the presence of the king, who, with one knee on the ground,
      held La Valliere round the waist with his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You heard, sire!" murmured Athenais. But the king did not reply; he
      remained with his eyes fixed upon La Valliere's half-closed eyes, and held
      her quiescent hand in his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," replied Saint-Aignan, who, on his side, hoping that
      Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, too, would faint, advancing towards her,
      holding his arms extended,&mdash;"of course; we did not even lose a single
      word." But the haughty Athenais was not a woman to faint easily; she
      darted a terrible look at Saint-Aignan, and fled. Montalais, with more
      courage, advanced hurriedly towards Louise, and received her from the
      king's hands, who was already fast losing his presence of mind, as he felt
      his face covered by the perfumed tresses of the seemingly dying girl.
      "Excellent," whispered Saint-Aignan. "This is indeed an adventure; and it
      will be my own fault if I am not the first to relate it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king approached him, and, with a trembling voice and a passionate
      gesture, said, "Not a syllable, comte."
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor king forgot that, only an hour before, he had given him a similar
      recommendation, but with the very opposite intention; namely, that the
      comte should be indiscreet. It followed, as a matter of course, that he
      latter recommendation was quite as unnecessary as the former. Half an hour
      afterwards, everybody in Fontainebleau knew that Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere had had a conversation under the royal oak with Montalais and
      Tonnay-Charente, and that in this conversation she had confessed her
      affection for the king. It was known, also, that the king, after having
      manifested the uneasiness with which Mademoiselle de la Valliere's health
      had inspired him, had turned pale, and trembled very much as he received
      the beautiful girl fainting into his arms; so that it was quite agreed
      among the courtiers, that the greatest event of the period had just been
      revealed; that his majesty loved Mademoiselle de la Valliere, and that,
      consequently, Monsieur could now sleep in perfect tranquillity. It was
      this, even, that the queen-mother, as surprised as the others by the
      sudden change, hastened to tell the young queen and Philip d'Orleans. Only
      she set to work in a different manner, by attacking them in the following
      way:&mdash;To her daughter-in-law she said, "See, now, Therese, how very
      wrong you were to accuse the king; now it is said he is devoted to some
      other person; why should there be any greater truth in the report of
      to-day than in that of yesterday, or in that of yesterday than in that of
      to-day?" To Monsieur, in relating to him the adventure of the royal oak,
      she said, "Are you not very absurd in your jealousies, my dear Philip? It
      is asserted that the king is madly in love with that little La Valliere.
      Say nothing of it to your wife; for the queen will know all about it very
      soon." This latter confidential communication had an immediate result.
      Monsieur, who had regained his composure, went triumphantly to look after
      his wife, and it was not yet midnight and the <i>fete</i> was to continue
      until two in the morning, he offered her his hand for a promenade. At the
      end of a few paces, however, the first thing he did was to disobey his
      mother's injunctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not tell any one, the queen least of all," he said mysteriously, "what
      people say about the king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do they say about him?" inquired Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That my brother has suddenly fallen in love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With Mademoiselle de la Valliere."
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was dark, Madame could smile at her ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" she said, "and how long is it since this has been the case?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For some days, it seems. But that was nothing but nonsense; it is only
      this evening that he has revealed his passion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king shows his good taste," said Madame; "in my opinion she is a very
      charming girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I verily believe you are jesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I! in what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In any case this passion will make some one very happy, even if it be
      only La Valliere herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really," continued the princess, "you speak as if you had read into the
      inmost recesses of La Valliere's heart. Who has told you that she agrees
      to return the king's affection?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who has told you that she will not return it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She loves the Vicomte de Bragelonne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is even affianced to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When they went to ask the king's permission to arrange the marriage, he
      refused his permission."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Refused?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, although the request was preferred by the Comte de la Fere himself,
      for whom the king has the greatest regard, on account of the part he took
      in your royal brother's restoration, and in other events, also, which
      happened a long time ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! the poor lovers must wait until the king is pleased to change his
      opinion; they are young, and there is time enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, dear me," said Philip, laughing, "I perceive you do not know the
      best part of the affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That by which the king was most deeply touched."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king, do you say, has been deeply touched?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the very quick of his heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how?&mdash;in what manner?&mdash;tell me directly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By an adventure, the romance of which cannot be equalled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know how I love to hear of such adventures, and yet you keep me
      waiting," said the princess, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then&mdash;" and Monsieur paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am listening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Under the royal oak&mdash;you know where the royal oak is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can that matter? Under the royal oak, you were saying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! Mademoiselle de la Valliere, fancying herself to be alone with her
      two friends, revealed to them her affection for the king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Madame, beginning to be uneasy, "her affection for the king?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When was this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About an hour ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame started, and then said, "And no one knew of this affection?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even his majesty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even his majesty. The artful little puss kept her secret strictly to
      herself, when suddenly it proved stronger than herself, and so escaped
      her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And from whom did you get this absurd tale?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, as everybody else did, from La Valliere herself, who confessed her
      love to Montalais and Tonnay-Charente, who were her companions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame stopped suddenly, and by a hasty movement let go her husband's
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you say it was an hour ago she made this confession?" Madame
      inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About that time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the king aware of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that is the very thing which constitutes the perfect romance of the
      affair, for the king was behind the royal oak with Saint-Aignan, and heard
      the whole of the interesting conversation without losing a single word of
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame felt struck to the heart, saying incautiously, "But I have seen the
      king since, and he never told me a word about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," said Monsieur; "he took care not to speak of it to you
      himself, since he recommended every one not to say a word about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" said Madame, growing angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that they wished to keep you in ignorance of the affair
      altogether."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why should they wish to conceal it from me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the fear that your friendship for the young queen might induce you
      to say something about it to her, nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame hung down her head; her feelings were grievously wounded. She could
      not enjoy a moment's repose until she had met the king. As a king is, most
      naturally, the very last person in his kingdom who knows what is said
      about him, in the same way that a lover is the only one who is kept in
      ignorance of what is said about his mistress, therefore, when the king
      perceived Madame, who was looking for him, he approached her in some
      perturbation, but still gracious and attentive in his manner. Madame
      waited for him to speak about La Valliere first; but as he did not speak
      of her, she said, "And the poor girl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What poor girl?" said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "La Valliere. Did you not tell me, sire, that she had fainted?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is still very ill," said the king, affecting the greatest
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But surely that will prejudicially affect the rumor you were going to
      spread, sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What rumor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That your attention was taken up by her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said the king, carelessly, "I trust it will be reported all the
      same."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame still waited; she wished to know if the king would speak to her of
      the adventure of the royal oak. But the king did not say a word about it.
      Madame, on her side, did not open her lips about it; so that the king took
      leave of her without having reposed the slightest confidence in her.
      Hardly had she watched the king move away, than she set out in search of
      Saint-Aignan. Saint-Aignan was never very difficult to find; he was like
      the smaller vessels that always follow in the wake of, and as tenders to,
      the larger ships. Saint-Aignan was the very man whom Madame needed in her
      then state of mind. And as for him, he only looked for worthier ears than
      others he had found to have an opportunity of recounting the event in all
      its details. And so he did not spare Madame a single word of the whole
      affair. When he had finished, Madame said to him, "Confess, now, that is
      his all a charming invention."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Invention, no; a true story, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confess, whether invention or true story, that it was told to you as you
      have told it to me, but that you were not there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my honor, Madame, I was there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you think that these confessions may have made an impression on the
      king?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, as those of Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente did upon me,"
      replied Saint-Aignan; "do not forget, Madame, that Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere compared the king to the sun; that was flattering enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king does not permit himself to be influenced by such flatteries."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, the king is just as much Adonis as Apollo; and I saw plain enough
      just now when La Valliere fell into his arms."
    </p>
    <p>
      "La Valliere fell into the king's arms!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! it was the most graceful picture possible; just imagine, La Valliere
      had fallen back fainting, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! what did you see?&mdash;tell me&mdash;speak!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw what ten other people saw at the same time as myself; I saw that
      when La Valliere fell into his arms, the king almost fainted himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame smothered a subdued cry, the only indication of her smothered
      anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," she said, laughing in a convulsive manner, "you relate
      stories delightfully, M. de Saint-Aignan." And she hurried away, alone,
      and almost suffocated by painful emotion, towards the chateau.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLIV. Courses de Nuit.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Monsieur quitted the princess in the best possible humor, and feeling
      greatly fatigued, retired to his apartments, leaving every one to finish
      the night as he chose. When in his room, Monsieur began to dress for the
      night with careful attention, which displayed itself from time to time in
      paroxysms of satisfaction. While his attendants were engaged in curling
      his hair, he sang the principal airs of the ballet which the violins had
      played, and to which the king had danced. He then summoned his tailors,
      inspected his costumes for the next day, and, in token of his extreme
      satisfaction, distributed various presents among them. As, however, the
      Chevalier de Lorraine, who had seen the prince return to the chateau,
      entered the room, Monsieur overwhelmed him with kindness. The former,
      after having saluted the prince, remained silent for a moment, like a
      sharpshooter who deliberates before deciding in what direction he will
      renew his fire; then, seeming to make up his mind, he said, "Have you
      remarked a very singular coincidence, monseigneur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The bad reception which his majesty, in appearance, gave the Comte de
      Guiche."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In appearance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, certainly; since, in reality, he has restored him to favor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not notice it," said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, did you not remark, that, instead of ordering him to go away again
      into exile, as was natural, he encouraged him in his opposition by
      permitting him to resume his place in the ballet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you think the king was wrong, chevalier?" said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you not of my opinion, prince?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not altogether so, my dear chevalier; and I think the king was quite
      right not to have made a disturbance against a poor fellow whose want of
      judgment is more to be complained of than his intention."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really," said the chevalier, "as far as I am concerned, I confess that
      this magnanimity astonishes me to the highest degree."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?" inquired Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I should have thought the king had been more jealous," replied
      the chevalier, spitefully. During the last few minutes Monsieur had felt
      there was something of an irritating nature concealed under his favorite's
      remarks; this last word, however, ignited the powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jealous!" exclaimed the prince. "Jealous! what do you mean? Jealous of
      what, if you please&mdash;or jealous of whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The chevalier perceived that he had allowed an excessively mischievous
      remark to escape him, as he was in the habit of doing. He endeavored,
      therefore, apparently to recall it while it was still possible to do so.
      "Jealous of his authority," he said, with an assumed frankness; "of what
      else would you have the king jealous?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said the prince, "that's very proper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did your royal highness," continued the chevalier, "solicit dear De
      Guiche's pardon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed," said Monsieur. "De Guiche is an excellent fellow, and full
      of courage; but as I do not approve of his conduct with Madame, I wish him
      neither harm nor good."
    </p>
    <p>
      The chevalier had assumed a bitterness with regard to De Guiche, as he had
      attempted to do with regard to the king; but he thought he perceived that
      the time for indulgence, and even for the utmost indifference, had
      arrived, and that, in order to throw some light on the question, it might
      be necessary for him to put the lamp, as the saying is, beneath the
      husband's very nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, very well," said the chevalier to himself, "I must wait for De
      Wardes; he will do more in one day than I in a month; for I verily believe
      he is even more envious than I. Then, again, it is not De Wardes I require
      so much as that some event or another should happen; and in the whole of
      this affair I see none. That De Guiche returned after he had been sent
      away is certainly serious enough, but all its seriousness disappears when
      I learn that De Guiche has returned at the very moment Madame troubles
      herself no longer about him. Madame, in fact, is occupied with the king,
      that is clear; but she will not be so much longer if, as it is asserted,
      the king has ceased to trouble his head about her. The moral of the whole
      matter is, to remain perfectly neutral, and await the arrival of some new
      caprice and let that decide the whole affair." And the chevalier thereupon
      settled himself resignedly in the armchair in which Monsieur permitted him
      to seat himself in his presence, and, having no more spiteful or malicious
      remarks to make, the consequence was that De Lorraine's wit seemed to have
      deserted him. Most fortunately Monsieur was in high good-humor, and he had
      enough for two, until the time arrived for dismissing his servants and
      gentlemen of the chamber, and he passed into his sleeping-apartment. As he
      withdrew, he desired the chevalier to present his compliments to Madame,
      and say that, as the night was cool, Monsieur, who was afraid of the
      toothache, would not venture out again into the park during the remainder
      of the evening. The chevalier entered the princess's apartments at the
      very moment she came in herself. He acquitted himself faithfully of the
      commission intrusted to him, and, in the first place, remarked all the
      indifference and annoyance with which Madame received her husband's
      communication&mdash;a circumstance which appeared to him fraught with
      something fresh. If Madame had been about to leave her apartments with
      that strangeness of manner, he would have followed her; but she was
      returning to them; there was nothing to be done, therefore he turned upon
      his heel like an unemployed heron, appearing to question earth, air, and
      water about it; shook his head, and walked away mechanically in the
      direction of the gardens. He had hardly gone a hundred paces when he met
      two young men, walking arm in arm, with their heads bent down, and idly
      kicking the small stones out of their path as they walked on, plunged in
      thought. It was De Guiche and De Bragelonne, the sight of whom, as it
      always did, produced upon the chevalier, instinctively, a feeling of
      repugnance. He did not, however, the less, on that account, salute them
      with a very low bow, which they returned with interest. Then, observing
      that the park was nearly deserted, that the illuminations began to burn
      out, and that the morning breeze was setting in, he turned to the left,
      and entered the chateau again, by one of the smaller courtyards. The
      others turned aside to the right, and continued on their way towards the
      large park. As the chevalier was ascending the side staircase, which led
      to the private entrance, he saw a woman, followed by another, make her
      appearance under the arcade which led from the small to the large
      courtyard. The two women walked so fast that the rustling of their dresses
      could be distinguished through the silence of the night. The style of
      their mantles, their graceful figures, a mysterious yet haughty carriage
      which distinguished them both, especially the one who walked first, struck
      the chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly know those two," he said to himself, pausing upon the top
      step of the small staircase. Then, as with the instinct of a bloodhound he
      was about to follow them, one of the servants who had been running after
      him arrested his attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," he said, "the courier has arrived."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said the chevalier, "there is time enough; to-morrow will
      do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are some urgent letters which you would be glad to see, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where from?" inquired the chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One from England, and the other from Calais; the latter arrived by
      express, and seems of great importance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Calais! Who the deuce can have to write to me from Calais?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I recognize the handwriting of Monsieur le Comte de Wardes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" cried the chevalier, forgetting his intention of acting the spy, "in
      that case I will come up at once." This he did, while the two unknown
      beings disappeared at the end of the court opposite to the one by which
      they had just entered. We shall now follow them, and leave the chevalier
      undisturbed to his correspondence. When they had arrived at the grove of
      trees, the foremost of the two halted, somewhat out of breath, and,
      cautiously raising her hood, said, "Are we still far from the tree?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Madame, more than five hundred paces; but pray rest awhile, you will
      not be able to walk much longer at this rate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," said the princes, for it was she; and she leaned against
      a tree. "And now," she resumed, after having recovered her breath, "tell
      me the whole truth, and conceal nothing from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Madame," cried the young girl, "you are already angry with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear Athenais, reassure yourself, I am in no way angry with you.
      After all, these things do not concern me personally. You are anxious
      about what you may have said under the oak; you are afraid of having
      offended the king, and I wish to tranquillize you by ascertaining myself
      if it were possible you could have been overheard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, Madame, the king was close to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, you were not speaking so loud that some of your remarks may not
      have been lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We thought we were quite alone, Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were three of you, you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; La Valliere, Montalais, and myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And <i>you</i>, individually, spoke in a light manner of the king?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid so. Should such be the case, will your highness have the
      kindness to make my peace with his majesty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there should be any occasion for it, I promise you I will do so.
      However, as I have already told you, it will be better not to anticipate
      evil. The night is now very dark, and the darkness is still greater under
      the trees. It is not likely you were recognized by the king. To inform him
      of it, by being the first to speak, is to denounce yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Madame, Madame! if Mademoiselle de la Valliere were recognized, I
      must have been recognized also. Besides, M. de Saint-Aignan left no doubt
      on the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you, then, say anything very disrespectful of the king?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all; it was one of the others who made some very flattering
      speeches about the king; and my remarks must have been much in contrast
      with hers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Montalais is such a giddy girl," said Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not Montalais. Montalais said nothing; it was La Valliere."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame started as if she had not known it perfectly well already. "No,
      no," she said, "the king cannot have heard. Besides, we will now try the
      experiment for which we came out. Show me the oak. Do you know where it
      is?" she continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! Madame, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you can find it again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With my eyes shut."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; sit down on the bank where you were, where La Valliere was,
      and speak in the same tone and to the same effect as you did before; I
      will conceal myself in the thicket, and if I can hear you, I will tell you
      so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If, therefore, you really spoke loud enough for the king to have heard
      you, in that case&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Athenais seemed to await the conclusion of the sentence with some anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case," said Madame, in a suffocated voice, arising doubtless from
      her hurried progress, "in that case, I forbid you&mdash;" And Madame again
      increased her pace. Suddenly, however, she stopped. "An idea occurs to
      me," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good idea, no doubt, Madame," replied Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Montalais must be as much embarrassed as La Valliere and yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Less so, for she is less compromised, having said less."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That does not matter; she will help you, I dare say, by deviating a
      little from the exact truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Especially if she knows that your highness is kind enough to interest
      yourself about me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, I think I have discovered what it is best for you all to
      pretend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How delightful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better say that all three of you were perfectly well aware that
      the king was behind the tree, or behind the thicket, whichever it might
      have been; and that you knew M. de Saint-Aignan was there too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For you cannot disguise it from yourself, Athenais, Saint-Aignan takes
      advantage of some very flattering remarks you made about him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Madame, you see very clearly that one can be overheard," cried
      Athenais, "since M. de Saint-Aignan overheard us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame bit her lips, for she had thoughtlessly committed herself. "Oh, you
      know Saint-Aignan's character very well," she said, "the favor the king
      shows him almost turns his brain, and he talks at random; not only so, he
      very often invents. That is not the question; the fact remains, did or did
      not the king overhear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, Madame, he certainly did," said Athenais, in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, do what I said: maintain boldly that all three of you knew&mdash;mind,
      all three of you, for if there is a doubt about any one of you, there will
      be a doubt about all,&mdash;persist, I say, that you knew that the king
      and M. de Saint-Aignan were there, and that you wished to amuse yourself
      at the expense of those who were listening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Madame, at the <i>king's</i> expense; we shall never dare say that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a simple jest; an innocent deception readily permitted in young
      girls whom men wish to take by surprise. In this manner everything
      explains itself. What Montalais said of Malicorne, a mere jest; what you
      said of M. de Saint-Aignan, a mere jest too; and what La Valliere might
      have said of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And which she would have given anything to recall."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure of that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, an additional reason. Say the whole affair was a mere joke. M.
      de Malicorne will have no occasion to get out of temper; M. de
      Saint-Aignan will be completely put out of countenance; <i>he</i> will be
      laughed at instead of you; and lastly, the king will be punished for a
      curiosity unworthy of his rank. Let people laugh a little at the king in
      this affair, and I do not think he will complain of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Madame, you are indeed an angel of goodness and sense!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is to my own advantage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you ask me why it is to my advantage to spare my maids of honor
      the remarks, annoyances, perhaps even calumnies, that might follow? Alas!
      you well know that the court has no indulgence for this sort of
      peccadillo. But we have now been walking for some time, shall we be long
      before we reach it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About fifty or sixty paces further; turn to the left, Madame, if you
      please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are sure of Montalais?" said Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will she do what you ask her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything. She will be delighted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And La Valliere&mdash;" ventured the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, there will be some difficulty with her, Madame; she would scorn to
      tell a falsehood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet, when it is in her interest to do so&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid that that would not make the slightest difference in her
      ideas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," said Madame. "I have been already told that; she is one of
      those overnice and affectedly particular people who place heaven in the
      foreground in order to conceal themselves behind it. But if she refuses to
      tell a falsehood,&mdash;as she will expose herself to the jests of the
      whole court, as she will have annoyed the king by a confession as
      ridiculous as it was immodest,&mdash;Mademoiselle la Baume le Blanc de la
      Valliere will think it but proper I should send her back again to her
      pigeons in the country, in order that, in Touraine yonder, or in Le
      Blaisois,&mdash;I know not where it may be,&mdash;she may at her ease
      study sentiment and pastoral life combined."
    </p>
    <p>
      These words were uttered with a vehemence and harshness that terrified
      Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente; and the consequence was, that, as far as
      she was concerned, she promised to tell as many falsehoods as might be
      necessary. It was in this frame of mind that Madame and her companion
      reached the precincts of the royal oak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here we are," said Tonnay-Charente.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall soon learn if one can overhear," replied Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" whispered the young girl, holding Madame back with a hurried
      gesture, entirely forgetful of her companion's rank. Madame stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see that you can hear," said Athenais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame held her breath; and, in fact, the following words pronounced by a
      gentle and melancholy voice, floated towards them:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you, vicomte, I tell you I love her madly; I tell you I love her
      to distraction."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame started at the voice; and, beneath her hood, a bright joyous smile
      illumined her features. It was she who now held back her companion, and
      with a light step leading her some twenty paces away, that is to say, out
      of the reach of the voice, she said, "Remain here, my dear Athenais, and
      let no one surprise us. I think it must be you they are conversing about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me, Madame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you&mdash;or rather your adventure. I will go and listen; if we were
      both there, we should be discovered. Or, stay!&mdash;go and fetch
      Montalais, and then return and wait for me with her at the entrance of the
      forest." And then, as Athenais hesitated, she again said "Go!" in a voice
      which did not admit of reply. Athenais thereupon arranged her dress so as
      to prevent its rustling being heard; and, by a path beyond the group of
      trees, she regained the flower-garden. As for Madame, she concealed
      herself in the thicket, leaning her back against a gigantic chestnut-tree,
      one of the branches of which had been cut in such a manner as to form a
      seat, and waited there, full of anxiety and apprehension. "Now," she said,
      "since one can hear from this place, let us listen to what M. de
      Bragelonne and that other madly-in-love fool, the Comte de Guiche, have to
      say about me."

    <h2>
      Chapter XLV. In Which Madame Acquires a Proof that Listeners Hear What Is
      Said.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a moment's silence, as if the mysterious sounds of night were
      hushed to listen, at the same time as Madame, to the youthful passionate
      disclosures of De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul was about to speak. He leaned indolently against the trunk of the
      large oak, and replied in his sweet and musical voice, "Alas, my dear De
      Guiche, it is a great misfortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," cried the latter, "great indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not understand me, De Guiche. I say that it is a great misfortune
      for you, not merely loving, but not knowing how to conceal your love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" said De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you do not perceive one thing; namely, that it is no longer to the
      only friend you have,&mdash;in other words,&mdash;to a man who would
      rather die than betray you; you do not perceive, I say, that it is no
      longer to your only friend that you confide your passion, but to the first
      person that approaches you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you mad, Bragelonne," exclaimed De Guiche, "to say such a thing to
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact stands thus, however."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible! How, in what manner can I have ever been indiscreet to such
      an extent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean, that your eyes, your looks, your sighs, proclaim, in spite of
      yourself, that exaggerated feeling which leads and hurries a man beyond
      his own control. In such a case he ceases to be master of himself; he is a
      prey to a mad passion, that makes him confide his grief to the trees, or
      to the air, from the very moment he has no longer any living being in
      reach of his voice. Besides, remember this: it very rarely happens that
      there is not always some one present to hear, especially the very things
      which ought <i>not</i> to be heard." De Guiche uttered a deep sigh. "Nay,"
      continued Bragelonne, "you distress me; since your return here, you have a
      thousand times, and in a thousand different ways, confessed your love for
      her; and yet, had you not said one word, your return alone would have been
      a terrible indiscretion. I persist, then, in drawing this conclusion; that
      if you do not place a better watch over yourself than you have hitherto
      done, one day or other something will happen that will cause an explosion.
      Who will save you then? Answer me. Who will save her? for, innocent as she
      will be of your affection, your affection will be an accusation against
      her in the hands of her enemies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" murmured De Guiche; and a deep sigh accompanied the exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not answering me, De Guiche."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what reply have you to make?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This, that when the day arrives I shall be no more a living being than I
      feel myself now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not understand you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So many vicissitudes have worn me out. At present, I am no more a
      thinking, acting being; at present, the most worthless of men is better
      than I am; my remaining strength is exhausted, my latest-formed
      resolutions have vanished, and I abandon myself to my fate. When a man is
      out campaigning, as we have been together, and he sets off alone and
      unaccompanied for a skirmish, it sometimes happens that he may meet with a
      party of five or six foragers, and although alone, he defends himself;
      afterwards, five or six others arrive unexpectedly, his anger is aroused
      and he persists; but if six, eight, or ten others should still be met
      with, he either sets spurs to his horse, if he should still happen to
      retain one, or lets himself be slain to save an ignominious flight. Such,
      indeed, is my own case: first, I had to struggle against myself;
      afterwards, against Buckingham; now, since the king is in the field, I
      will not contend against the king, nor even, I wish you to understand,
      will the king retire; nor even against the nature of that woman. Still I
      do not deceive myself; having devoted myself to the service of such a
      love, I will lose my life in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not the lady you ought to reproach," replied Raoul; "it is
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know the princess's character,&mdash;somewhat giddy, easily
      captivated by novelty, susceptible to flattery, whether it come from a
      blind person or a child, and yet you allow your passion for her to eat
      your very life away. Look at her,&mdash;love her, if you will,&mdash;for
      no one whose heart is not engaged elsewhere can see her without loving
      her. Yet, while you love her, respect, in the first place, her husband's
      rank, then herself, and lastly, your own safety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, Raoul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, seeing how much I suffer through this woman, you endeavor to
      console me, because you tell me all the good of her you think, and perhaps
      even that which you do not think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said Raoul, "there you are wrong, comte; what I think I do not
      always say, but in that case I say nothing; but when I speak, I know not
      how to feign or to deceive; and whoever listens to me may believe me."
    </p>
    <p>
      During this conversation, Madame, her head stretched forward with eager
      ear and dilated glance, endeavoring to penetrate the obscurity, thirstily
      drank in the faintest sound of their voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I know her better than you do, then!" exclaimed Guiche. "She is not
      merely giddy, but frivolous; she is not only attracted by novelty, she is
      utterly oblivious, and is without faith; she is not simply susceptible to
      flattery, she is a practiced and cruel coquette. A thorough coquette! yes,
      yes, I am sure of it. Believe me, Bragelonne, I am suffering all the
      torments of hell; brave, passionately fond of danger, I meet a danger
      greater than my strength and my courage. But, believe me, Raoul, I reserve
      for myself a victory which shall cost her floods of tears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A victory," he asked, "and of what kind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of what kind, you ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One day I will accost her, and will address her thus: 'I was young&mdash;
      madly in love, I possessed, however, sufficient respect to throw myself at
      your feet, and to prostrate myself in the dust, if your looks had not
      raised me to your hand. I fancied I understood your looks, I rose, and
      then, without having done anything more towards you than love you yet more
      devotedly, if that were possible&mdash;you, a woman without heart, faith,
      or love, in very wantonness, dashed me down again from sheer caprice. You
      are unworthy, princess of the royal blood though you may be, of the love
      of a man of honor; I offer my life as a sacrifice for having loved you too
      tenderly, and I die despairing you.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" cried Raoul, terrified at the accents of profound truth which De
      Guiche's words betrayed, "I was right in saying you were mad, Guiche."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," exclaimed De Guiche, following out his own idea; "since there
      are no wars here now, I will flee yonder to the north, seek service in the
      Empire, where some Hungarian, or Croat, or Turk, will perhaps kindly put
      me out of my misery." De Guiche did not finish, or rather as he finished,
      a sound made him start, and at the same moment caused Raoul to leap to his
      feet. As for De Guiche, buried in his own thoughts, he remained seated,
      with his head tightly pressed between his hands. The branches of the tree
      were pushed aside, and a woman, pale and much agitated, appeared before
      the two young men. With one hand she held back the branches, which would
      have struck her face, and, with the other, she raised the hood of the
      mantle which covered her shoulders. By her clear and lustrous glance, by
      her lofty carriage, by her haughty attitude, and, more than all that, by
      the throbbing of his own heart, De Guiche recognized Madame, and, uttering
      a loud cry, he removed his hands from his temple, and covered his eyes
      with them. Raoul, trembling and out of countenance, merely muttered a few
      words of respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur de Bragelonne," said the princess, "have the goodness, I beg, to
      see if my attendants are not somewhere yonder, either in the walks or in
      the groves; and you, M. de Guiche, remain here: I am tired, and you will
      perhaps give me your arm."
    </p>
    <p>
      Had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of the unhappy young man, he would
      have been less terrified than by her cold and severe tone. However, as he
      himself had just said, he was brave; and as in the depths of his own heart
      he had just decisively made up his mind, De Guiche arose, and, observing
      Bragelonne's hesitation, he turned towards him a glance full of
      resignation and grateful acknowledgement. Instead of immediately answering
      Madame, he even advanced a step towards the vicomte, and holding out the
      arm which the princess had just desired him to give her, he pressed his
      friend's hand in his own, with a sigh, in which he seemed to give to
      friendship all the life that was left in the depths of his heart. Madame,
      who in her pride had never known what it was to wait, now waited until
      this mute colloquy was at an end. Her royal hand remained suspended in the
      air, and, when Raoul had left, it sank without anger, but not without
      emotion, in that of De Guiche. They were alone in the depths of the dark
      and silent forest, and nothing could be heard but Raoul's hastily
      retreating footsteps along the obscure paths. Over their heads was
      extended the thick and fragrant vault of branches, through the occasional
      openings of which the stars could be seen glittering in their beauty.
      Madame softly drew De Guiche about a hundred paces away from that
      indiscreet tree which had heard, and had allowed so many things to be
      heard, during the evening, and, leading him to a neighboring glade, so
      that they could see a certain distance around them, she said in a
      trembling voice, "I have brought you here, because yonder where you were,
      everything can be overheard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything can be overheard, did you say, Madame?" replied the young man,
      mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which means&mdash;" murmured De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which means that I have heard every syllable you have said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Heaven! this only was wanting to destroy me," stammered De Guiche;
      and he bent down his head, like an exhausted swimmer beneath the wave
      which engulfs him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so," she said, "you judge me as you have said?" De Guiche grew pale,
      turned his head aside, and was silent. He felt almost on the point of
      fainting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not complain," continued the princess, in a tone of voice full of
      gentleness; "I prefer a frankness that wounds me, to flattery, which would
      deceive me. And so, according to your opinion, M. de Guiche, I am a
      coquette, an a worthless creature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Worthless," cried the young man; "you worthless! Oh, no; most certainly I
      did not say, I could not have said, that that which was the most precious
      object in life for me could be worthless. No, no; I did not say that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman who sees a man perish, consumed by the fire she has kindled, and
      who does not allay that fire, is, in my opinion, a worthless woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can it matter to you what I said?" returned the comte. "What am I
      compared to you, and why should you even trouble yourself to know whether
      I exist or not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur de Guiche, both you and I are human beings, and, knowing you as
      I do, I do not wish you to risk your life; with you I will change my
      conduct and character. I will be, not frank, for I am always so, but
      truthful. I implore you, therefore, to love me no more, and to forget
      utterly that I have ever addressed a word or a glance towards you."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche turned around, bending a look full of passionate devotion upon
      her. "You," he said; "<i>you</i> excuse yourself; <i>you</i> implore me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly; since I have done evil, I ought to repair the evil I have
      done. And so, comte, this is what we will agree to. You will forgive my
      frivolity and my coquetry. Nay, do not interrupt me. I will forgive you
      for having said I was frivolous and a coquette, or something worse,
      perhaps; and you will renounce your idea of dying, and will preserve for
      your family, for the king, and for our sex, a cavalier whom every one
      esteems, and whom many hold dear." Madame pronounced this last word in
      such an accent of frankness, and even of tenderness, that poor De Guiche's
      heart felt almost bursting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Madame, Madame!" he stammered out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, listen further," she continued. "When you shall have renounced all
      thought of me forever, from necessity in the first place, and, next,
      because you will yield to my entreaty, then you will judge me more
      favorably, and I am convinced you will replace this love&mdash;forgive the
      frivolity of the expression&mdash;by a sincere friendship, which you will
      be ready to offer me, and which, I promise you, shall be cordially
      accepted."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche, his forehead bedewed with perspiration, a feeling of death in
      his heart, and a trembling agitation through his whole frame, bit his lip,
      stamped his foot on the ground, and, in a word, devoured the bitterness of
      his grief. "Madame," he said, "what you offer is impossible, and I cannot
      accept such conditions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" said Madame, "do you refuse my friendship, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no! I do not need your friendship, Madame. I prefer to die from love,
      than to live for friendship."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comte!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Madame," cried De Guiche, "the present is a moment for me, in which
      no other consideration and no other respect exist, than the consideration
      and respect of a man of honor towards the woman he worships. Drive me
      away, curse me, denounce me, you will be perfectly right. I have uttered
      complaints against you, but their bitterness has been owing to my passion
      for you; I have said I wish to die, and die I will. If I lived, you would
      forget me; but dead, you would never forget me, I am sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Henrietta, who was standing buried in thought, and nearly as agitated as
      De Guiche himself, turned aside her head as but a minute before he had
      turned aside his. Then, after a moment's pause, she said, "And you love
      me, then, very much?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madly; madly enough to die from it, whether you drive me from you, or
      whether you listen to me still."

    <p>
      "It is a hopeless case," she said, in a playful manner; "a case which must
      be treated with soothing application. Give me your hand. It is as cold as
      ice." De Guiche knelt down, and pressed to his lips, not one, but both of
      Madame's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love me, then," said the princess, "since it cannot be otherwise." And
      almost imperceptibly she pressed his fingers, raising him thus, partly in
      the manner of a queen, and partly as a fond and affectionate woman would
      have done. De Guiche trembled from head to foot, and Madame, who felt how
      passion coursed through every fiber of his being, knew that he indeed
      loved truly. "Give me your arm, comte," she said, "and let us return."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Madame," said the comte, trembling and bewildered; "you have
      discovered a third way of killing me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, happily, it is the slowest way, is it not?" she replied, as she led
      him towards the grove of trees they had so lately quitted.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLVI. Aramis's Correspondence.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When De Guiche's affairs, which had been suddenly set to right without his
      having been able to guess the cause of their improvement, assumed the
      unexpected aspect we have seen, Raoul, in obedience to the request of the
      princess, had withdrawn in order not to interrupt an explanation, the
      results of which he was far from guessing; and he soon after joined the
      ladies of honor who were walking about in the flower-gardens. During this
      time, the Chevalier de Lorraine, who had returned to his own room, read De
      Wardes's latter with surprise, for it informed him by the hand of his
      valet, of the sword-thrust received at Calais, and of all the details of
      the adventure, and invited him to inform De Guiche and Monsieur, whatever
      there might be in the affair likely to be most disagreeable to both of
      them. De Wardes particularly endeavored to prove to the chevalier the
      violence of Madame's affection for Buckingham, and he finished his letter
      by declaring that he thought this feeling was returned. The chevalier
      shrugged his shoulders at the last paragraph, and, in fact, De Wardes was
      out of date, as we have seen. De Wardes was still only at Buckingham's
      affair. The chevalier threw the letter over his shoulder upon an adjoining
      table, and said in a disdainful tone, "It is really incredible; and yet
      poor De Wardes is not deficient in ability; but the truth is, it is not
      very apparent, so easy is it to grow rusty in the country. The deuce take
      the simpleton, who ought to have written to me about matters of
      importance, and yet he writes such silly stuff as that. If it had not been
      for that miserable letter, which has no meaning at all in it, I should
      have detected in the grove yonder a charming little intrigue, which would
      have compromised a woman, would have perhaps have been as good as a
      sword-thrust for a man, and have diverted Monsieur for many days to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch. "It is now too late," he said. "One o'clock in the
      morning; every one must have returned to the king's apartments, where the
      night is to be finished; well, the scent is lost, and unless some
      extraordinary chance&mdash;" And thus saying, as if to appeal to his good
      star, the chevalier, greatly out of temper, approached the window, which
      looked out upon a somewhat solitary part of the garden. Immediately, and
      as if some evil genius was at his orders, he perceived returning towards
      the chateau, accompanied by a man, a silk mantle of a dark color, and
      recognized the figure which had struck his attention half an hour
      previously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Admirable!" he thought, striking his hands together, "this is my
      providential mysterious affair." And he started out precipitately, along
      the staircase, hoping to reach the courtyard in time to recognize the
      woman in the mantle, and her companion. But as he arrived at the door of
      the little court, he nearly knocked against Madame, whose radiant face
      seemed full of charming revelations beneath the mantle which protected
      without concealing her. Unfortunately, Madame was alone. The chevalier
      knew that since he had seen her, not five minutes before, with a
      gentleman, the gentleman in question could not be far off. Consequently,
      he hardly took time to salute the princess as he drew up to allow her to
      pass; then when she had advanced a few steps, with the rapidity of a woman
      who fears recognition, and when the chevalier perceived that she was too
      much occupied with her own thoughts to trouble herself about him, he
      darted into the garden, looked hastily round on every side, and embraced
      within his glance as much of the horizon as he possibly could. He was just
      in time; the gentleman who had accompanied Madame was still in sight; only
      he was hurrying towards one of the wings of the chateau, behind which he
      was on the point of disappearing. There was not an instant to lose; the
      chevalier darted in pursuit of him, prepared to slacken his pace as he
      approached the unknown; but in spite of the diligence he used, the unknown
      had disappeared behind the flight of steps before he approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident, however, that as the man pursued was walking quietly, in a
      pensive manner, with his head bent down, either beneath the weight of
      grief or happiness, when once the angle was passed, unless, indeed, he
      were to enter by some door or another, the chevalier could not fail to
      overtake him. And this, certainly, would have happened, if, at the very
      moment he turned the angle, the chevalier had not run against two persons,
      who were themselves wheeling in the opposite direction. The chevalier was
      ready to seek a quarrel with these two troublesome intruders, when,
      looking up, he recognized the superintendent. Fouquet was accompanied by a
      person whom the chevalier now saw for the first time. This stranger was
      the bishop of Vannes. Checked by the important character of the
      individual, and obliged out of politeness to make his own excuses when he
      expected to receive them, the chevalier stepped back a few paces; and as
      Monsieur Fouquet possessed, if not the friendship, at least the respect of
      every one; as the king himself, although he was rather his enemy than his
      friend, treated M. Fouquet as a man of great consideration, the chevalier
      did what the king himself would have done, namely, he bowed to M. Fouquet,
      who returned his salutation with kindly politeness, perceiving that the
      gentleman had run against him by mistake and without any intention of
      being rude. Then, almost immediately afterwards, having recognized the
      Chevalier de Lorraine, he made a few civil remarks, to which the chevalier
      was obliged to reply. Brief as the conversation was, De Lorraine saw, with
      the most unfeigned displeasure, the figure of his unknown becoming dimmer
      in the distance, and fast disappearing in the darkness. The chevalier
      resigned himself, and, once resigned, gave his entire attention to
      Fouquet:&mdash;"You arrive late, monsieur," he said. "Your absence has
      occasioned great surprise, and I heard Monsieur express himself as much
      astonished that, having been invited by the king, you had not come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was impossible for me to do so; but I came as soon as I was free."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Paris quiet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly so. Paris has received the last tax very well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! I understand you wished to assure yourself of this good feeling
      before you came to participate in our <i>fetes</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have arrived, however, somewhat late to enjoy them. I will ask you,
      therefore, to inform me if the king is in the chateau or not, if I am
      likely to be able to see him this evening, or if I shall have to wait
      until to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have lost sight of his majesty during the last half-hour nearly," said
      the chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps he is in Madame's apartments?" inquired Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in Madame's apartments, I should think, for I just now met Madame as
      she was entering by the small staircase; and unless the gentleman whom you
      a moment ago encountered was the king himself&mdash;" and the chevalier
      paused, hoping that, in this manner, he might learn who it was he had been
      hurrying after. But Fouquet, whether he had or had not recognized De
      Guiche, simply replied, "No, monsieur, it was not the king."
    </p>
    <p>
      The chevalier, disappointed in his expectation, saluted them; but as he
      did so, casting a parting glance around him, and perceiving M. Colbert in
      the center of a group, he said to the superintendent: "Stay, monsieur;
      there is some one under the trees yonder, who will be able to inform you
      better than myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who?" asked Fouquet, whose near-sightedness prevented him from seeing
      through the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. Colbert," returned the chevalier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! That person, then, who is speaking yonder to those men with
      torches in their hands, is M. Colbert?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. Colbert himself. He is giving orders personally to the workmen who are
      arranging the lamps for the illuminations."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said Fouquet, with an inclination of the head, which
      indicated that he had obtained all the information he wished. The
      chevalier, on his side, having, on the contrary, learned nothing at all,
      withdrew with a profound salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely left when Fouquet, knitting his brows, fell into a deep
      reverie. Aramis looked at him for a moment with a mingled feeling of
      compassion and silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" he said to him, "the fellow's name alone seemed to affect you. Is
      it possible that, full of triumph and delight as you were just now, the
      sight merely of that man is capable of dispiriting you? Tell me, have you
      faith in your good star?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied Fouquet, dejectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I am too full of happiness at this present moment," he replied,
      in a trembling voice. "You, my dear D'Herblay, who are so learned, will
      remember the history of a certain tyrant of Samos. What can I throw into
      the sea to avert approaching evil? Yes! I repeat it once more, I am too
      full of happiness! so happy that I wish for nothing beyond what I have...
      I have risen so high... You know my motto: '<i>Quo non ascendam?</i>' I
      have risen so high that nothing is left me but to descend from my
      elevation. I cannot believe in the progress of a success already more than
      human."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis smiled as he fixed his kind and penetrating glance upon him. "If I
      were aware of the cause of your happiness," he said, "I should probably
      fear for your grace; but you regard me in the light of a true friend; I
      mean, you turn to me in misfortune, nothing more. Even that is an immense
      and precious boon, I know; but the truth is, I have a just right to beg
      you to confide in me, from time to time, any fortunate circumstances that
      befall you, in which I should rejoice, you know, more than if they had
      befallen myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear prelate," said Fouquet, laughing, "my secrets are of too profane
      a character to confide them to a bishop, however great a worldling he may
      be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah! in confession."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I should blush too much if you were my confessor." And Fouquet began
      to sigh. Aramis again looked at him without further betrayal of his
      thoughts than a placid smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "discretion is a great virtue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silence," said Fouquet; "yonder venomous reptile has recognized us, and
      is crawling this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Colbert?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; leave me, D'Herblay; I do not wish that fellow to see you with me,
      or he will take an aversion to <i>you</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis pressed his hand, saying, "What need have I of his friendship,
      while you are here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but I may not always be here," replied Fouquet, dejectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On that day, then, if that day should ever dawn," said Aramis,
      tranquilly, "we will think over a means of dispensing with the friendship,
      or of braving the dislike of M. Colbert. But tell me, my dear Fouquet,
      instead of conversing with this reptile, as you did him the honor of
      styling him, a conversation the need for which I do not perceive, why do
      you not pay a visit, if not to the king, at least to Madame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Madame," said the superintendent, his mind occupied by his <i>souvenirs</i>.
      "Yes, certainly, to Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You remember," continued Aramis, "that we have been told that Madame
      stands high in favor during the last two or three days. It enters into
      your policy, and forms part of our plans, that you should assiduously
      devote yourself to his majesty's friends. It is a means of counteracting
      the growing influence of M. Colbert. Present yourself, therefore, as soon
      as possible to Madame, and, for our sakes, treat this ally with
      consideration."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Fouquet, "are you quite sure that it is upon her that the king
      has his eyes fixed at the present moment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If the needle has turned, it must be since the morning. You know I have
      my police."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well! I will go there at once, and, at all events, I shall have a
      means of introduction in the shape of a magnificent pair of antique cameos
      set with diamonds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have seen them, and nothing could be more costly and regal."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment they were interrupted by a servant followed by a courier.
      "For you, monseigneur," said the courier aloud, presenting a letter to
      Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For your grace," said the lackey in a low tone, handing Aramis a letter.
      And as the lackey carried a torch in his hand, he placed himself between
      the superintendent and the bishop of Vannes, so that both of them could
      read at the same time. As Fouquet looked at the fine and delicate writing
      on the envelope, he started with delight. Those who love, or who are
      beloved, will understand his anxiety in the first place, and his happiness
      in the next. He hastily tore open the letter, which, however, contained
      only these words: "It is but an hour since I quitted you, it is an age
      since I told you how much I love you." And that was all. Madame de
      Belliere had, in fact, left Fouquet about an hour previously, after having
      passed two days with him; and apprehensive lest his remembrance of her
      might be effaced for too long a period from the heart she regretted, she
      dispatched a courier to him as the bearer of this important communication.
      Fouquet kissed the letter, and rewarded the bearer with a handful of gold.
      As for Aramis, he, on his side, was engaged in reading, but with more
      coolness and reflection, the following letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king has this evening been struck with a strange fancy; a woman loves
      him. He learned it accidentally, as he was listening to the conversation
      of this young girl with her companions; and his majesty has entirely
      abandoned himself to his new caprice. The girl's name is Mademoiselle de
      la Valliere, and she is sufficiently pretty to warrant this caprice
      becoming a strong attachment. Beware of Mademoiselle de la Valliere."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not a word about Madame. Aramis slowly folded the letter and put
      it in his pocket. Fouquet was still delightedly inhaling the perfume of
      his epistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur," said Aramis, touching Fouquet's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, what is it?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An idea has just occurred to me. Are you acquainted with a young girl of
      the name of La Valliere?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reflect a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! yes, I believe so; one of Madame's maids of honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That must be the one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, monseigneur, it is to that young girl that you must pay your visit
      this evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah! why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, more than that, it is to her you must present your cameos."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know, monseigneur, that my advice is not to be regarded lightly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But this is unforeseen&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is my affair. Pay your court in due form, and without loss of time,
      to Mademoiselle de la Valliere. I will be your guarantee with Madame de
      Belliere that your devotion is altogether politic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean, my dear D'Herblay, and whose name have you just
      pronounced?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A name which ought to convince you that, as I am so well informed about
      yourself, I may possibly be just as well informed about others. Pay your
      court, therefore, to La Valliere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will pay my court to whomsoever you like," replied Fouquet, his heart
      filled with happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, descend again to the earth, traveler in the seventh heaven,"
      said Aramis; "M. Colbert is approaching. He has been recruiting while we
      were reading; see, how he is surrounded, praised, congratulated; he is
      decidedly becoming powerful." In fact, Colbert was advancing, escorted by
      all the courtiers who remained in the gardens, every one of whom
      complimented him upon the arrangements of the <i>fete</i>: all of which so
      puffed him up that he could hardly contain himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If La Fontaine were here," said Fouquet, smiling, "what an admirable
      opportunity for him to recite his fable of 'The Frog that wanted to make
      itself as big as the Ox.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Colbert arrived in the center of the circle blazing with light; Fouquet
      awaited his approach, unmoved and with a slightly mocking smile. Colbert
      smiled too; he had been observing his enemy during the last quarter of an
      hour, and had been approaching him gradually. Colbert's smile was a
      presage of hostility.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, oh!" said Aramis, in a low tone of voice to the superintendent; "the
      scoundrel is going to ask you again for more millions to pay for his
      fireworks and his colored lamps." Colbert was the first to salute them,
      and with an air which he endeavored to render respectful. Fouquet hardly
      moved his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, monseigneur, what do your eyes say? Have we shown our good taste?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfect taste," replied Fouquet, without permitting the slightest tone of
      raillery to be remarked in his words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Colbert, maliciously, "you are treating us with indulgence. We
      are poor, we servants of the king, and Fontainebleau is no way to be
      compared as a residence with Vaux."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true," replied Fouquet coolly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what can we do, monseigneur?" continued Colbert, "we have done our
      best on slender resources."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet made a gesture of assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," pursued Colbert, "it would be only a proper display of your
      magnificence, monseigneur, if you were to offer to his majesty a <i>fete</i>
      in your wonderful gardens&mdash;in those gardens which have cost you sixty
      millions of francs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seventy-two," said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An additional reason," returned Colbert; "it would, indeed, be truly
      magnificent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But do you suppose, monsieur, that his majesty would deign to accept my
      invitation?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no doubt whatever of it," cried Colbert, hastily; "I will
      guarantee that he does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are exceedingly kind," said Fouquet. "I may depend on it, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, monseigneur; yes, certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I will consider the matter," yawned Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Accept, accept," whispered Aramis, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will consider?" repeated Colbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied Fouquet; "in order to know what day I shall submit my
      invitation to the king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This very evening, monseigneur, this very evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Agreed," said the superintendent. "Gentlemen, I should wish to issue my
      invitations; but you know that wherever the king goes, the king is in his
      own palace; it is by his majesty, therefore, that you must be invited." A
      murmur of delight immediately arose. Fouquet bowed and left.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proud and dauntless man," thought Colbert, "you accept, and yet you know
      it will cost you ten millions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have ruined me," whispered Fouquet, in a low tone, to Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have saved you," replied the latter, whilst Fouquet ascended the flight
      of steps and inquired whether the king was still visible.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLVII. The Orderly Clerk.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king, anxious to be again quite alone, in order to reflect well upon
      what was passing in his heart, had withdrawn to his own apartments, where
      M. de Saint-Aignan had, after his conversation with Madame, gone to meet
      him. This conversation has already been related. The favorite, vain of his
      twofold importance, and feeling that he had become, during the last two
      hours, the confidant of the king, began to treat the affairs of the court
      in a somewhat indifferent manner: and, from the position in which he had
      placed himself, or rather, where chance had placed him, he saw nothing but
      love and garlands of flowers around him. The king's love for Madame, that
      of Madame for the king, that of Guiche for Madame, that of La Valliere for
      the king, that of Malicorne for Montalais, that of Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente for himself, was not all this, truly, more than enough to
      turn the head of any courtier? Besides, Saint-Aignan was the model of
      courtiers, past, present, and to come; and, moreover, showed himself such
      an excellent narrator, and so discerningly appreciative that the king
      listened to him with an appearance of great interest, particularly when he
      described the excited manner with which Madame had sought for him to
      converse about the affair of Mademoiselle de la Valliere. While the king
      no longer experienced for Madame any remains of the passion he had once
      felt for her, there was, in this same eagerness of Madame to procure
      information about him, great gratification for his vanity, from which he
      could not free himself. He experienced this pleasure then, but nothing
      more, and his heart was not, for a single moment, alarmed at what Madame
      might, or might not, think of his adventure. When, however, Saint-Aignan
      had finished, the king, while preparing to retire to rest, asked, "Now,
      Saint-Aignan, you know what Mademoiselle de la Valliere is, do you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not only what she is, but what she will be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean that she is everything that woman can wish to be&mdash;that is to
      say, beloved by your majesty; I mean, that she will be everything your
      majesty may wish her to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not what I am asking. I do not wish to know what she is to-day,
      or what she will be to-morrow; as you have remarked, that is my affair.
      But tell me what others say of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They say she is well conducted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said the king, smiling, "that is mere report."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But rare enough, at court, sire, to believe when it is spread."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you are right. Is she well born?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellently; the daughter of the Marquis de la Valliere, and
      step-daughter of that good M. de Saint-Remy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes! my aunt's major-domo; I remember; and I remember now that I saw
      her as I passed through Blois. She was presented to the queens. I have
      even to reproach myself that I did not on that occasion pay her the
      attention she deserved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sire! I trust that your majesty will now repair time lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the report&mdash;you tell me&mdash;is, that Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere never had a lover."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In any case, I do not think your majesty would be much alarmed at the
      rivalry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet, stay," said the king, in a very serious tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she has no lover, she has, at least, a betrothed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A betrothed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! Count, do you not know that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, the man who knows all the news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty will excuse me. You know this betrothed, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assuredly! his father came to ask me to sign the marriage contract: it is&mdash;"
      The king was about to pronounce the Vicomte de Bragelonne's name, when he
      stopped, and knitted his brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is&mdash;" repeated Saint-Aignan, inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't remember now," replied Louis XIV., endeavoring to conceal an
      annoyance he had some trouble to disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I put your majesty in the way?" inquired the Comte de Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; for I no longer remember to whom I intended to refer; indeed, I only
      remember very indistinctly, that one of the maids of honor was to marry&mdash;the
      name, however, has escaped me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente he was going to marry?" inquired
      Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very likely," said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, the intended was M. de Montespan; but Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente did not speak of it, it seemed to me, in such a manner as
      would frighten suitors away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events," said the king, "I know nothing, or almost nothing, about
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere. Saint-Aignan, I rely upon you to procure me
      every information about her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire, and when shall I have the honor of seeing your majesty again,
      to give you the latest news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whenever you have procured it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall obtain it speedily, then, if the information can be as quickly
      obtained as my wish to see your majesty again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well said, count! By the by, has Madame displayed any ill-feeling against
      this poor girl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame did not get angry, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know; I only know that she laughed continually."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's well; but I think I hear voices in the ante-rooms&mdash;no doubt a
      courier has just arrived. Inquire, Saint-Aignan." The count ran to the
      door and exchanged a few words with the usher; he returned to the king,
      saying, "Sire, it is M. Fouquet who has this moment arrived, by your
      majesty's orders, he says. He presented himself, but, because of the
      lateness of the hour, he does not press for an audience this evening, and
      is satisfied to have his presence here formally announced."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. Fouquet! I wrote to him at three o'clock, inviting him to be at
      Fontainebleau the following day, and he arrives at Fontainebleau at two
      o'clock in the morning! This is, indeed, zeal!" exclaimed the king,
      delighted to see himself so promptly obeyed. "On the contrary, M. Fouquet
      shall have his audience. I summoned him, and will receive him. Let him be
      introduced. As for you, count, pursue your inquiries, and be here
      to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king placed his finger on his lips; and Saint-Aignan, his heart
      brimful of happiness, hastily withdrew, telling the usher to introduce M.
      Fouquet, who, thereupon, entered the king's apartment. Louis rose to
      receive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening, M. Fouquet," he said, smiling graciously; "I congratulate
      you on your punctuality; and yet my message must have reached you late?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At nine in the evening, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been working very hard lately, M. Fouquet, for I have been
      informed that you have not left your rooms at Saint-Mande during the last
      three or four days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is perfectly true, your majesty, that I have kept myself shut up for
      the past three days," replied Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, M. Fouquet, that I had a great many things to say to you?"
      continued the king, with a most gracious air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty overwhelms me, and since you are so graciously disposed
      towards me, will you permit me to remind you of the promise made to grant
      an audience?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes! some church dignitary, who thinks he has to thank me for
      something, is it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely so, sire. The hour is, perhaps, badly chosen; but the time of
      the companion whom I have brought with me is valuable, and as
      Fontainebleau is on the way to his diocese&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is it, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The bishop of Vannes, whose appointment your majesty, at my
      recommendation, deigned, three months since, to sign."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is very possible," said the king, who had signed without reading;
      "and he is here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire; Vannes is an important diocese; the flock belonging to this
      pastor needed his religious consolation; they are savages, whom it is
      necessary to polish, at the same time that he instructs them, and M.
      d'Herblay is unequalled in such kind of missions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. d'Herblay!" said the king, musingly, as if his name, heard long since,
      was not, however, unknown to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Fouquet, promptly, "your majesty is not acquainted with the
      obscure name of one of your most faithful and valuable servants?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I confess I am not. And so he wishes to set off again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has this very day received letters which will, perhaps, compel him to
      leave, so that, before setting off for that unknown region called
      Bretagne, he is desirous of paying his respects to your majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he waiting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is here, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him enter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet made a sign to the usher in attendance, who was waiting behind the
      tapestry. The door opened, and Aramis entered. The king allowed him to
      finish the compliments which he addressed to him, and fixed a long look
      upon a countenance which no one could forget, after having once beheld it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vannes!" he said: "you are bishop of Vannes, I believe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Vannes is in Bretagne, I think?" Aramis bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Near the coast?" Aramis again bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A few leagues from Bell-Isle, is it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire," replied Aramis; "six leagues, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Six leagues; a mere step, then," said Louis XIV.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for us poor Bretons, sire," replied Aramis: "six leagues, on the
      contrary, is a great distance, if it be six leagues on land; and an
      immense distance, if it be leagues on the sea. Besides, I have the honor
      to mention to your majesty that there are six leagues of sea from the
      river to Belle-Isle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is said that M. Fouquet has a very beautiful house there?" inquired
      the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it is said so," replied Aramis, looking quietly at Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by 'it is said so?'" exclaimed the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, M. Fouquet, I must confess that one circumstance surprises me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What may that be, sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you should have at the head of the diocese a man like M. d'Herblay,
      and yet should not have shown him Belle-Isle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sire," replied the bishop, without giving Fouquet time to answer, "we
      poor Breton prelates seldom leave our residences."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Vannes," said the king, "I will punish M. Fouquet for his
      indifference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way, sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will change your bishopric."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet bit his lips, but Aramis only smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What income does Vannes bring you in?" continued the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sixty thousand livres, sire," said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So trifling an amount as that; but you possess other property, Monsieur
      de Vannes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have nothing else, sire; only M. Fouquet pays me one thousand two
      hundred livres a year for his pew in the church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, M. d'Herblay, I promise you something better than that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not forget you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis bowed, and the king also bowed to him in a respectful manner, as he
      was accustomed to do towards women and members of the Church. Aramis
      gathered that his audience was at an end; he took his leave of the king in
      the simple, unpretending language of a country pastor, and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is, indeed, a remarkable face," said the king, following him with his
      eyes as long as he could see him, and even to a certain degree when he was
      no longer to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire," replied Fouquet, "if that bishop had been educated early in life,
      no prelate in the kingdom would deserve the highest distinctions better
      than he."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His learning is not extensive, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He changed the sword for the crucifix, and that rather late in life. But
      it matters little, if your majesty will permit me to speak of M. de Vannes
      again on another occasion&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg you to do so. But before speaking of him, let us speak of yourself,
      M. Fouquet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of me, sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I have to pay you a thousand compliments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot express to your majesty the delight with which you overwhelm
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand you, M. Fouquet. I confess, however, to have had certain
      prejudices against you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, I was indeed unhappy, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they exist no longer. Did you not perceive&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did, indeed, sire; but I awaited with resignation the day when the
      truth would prevail; and it seems that that day has now arrived."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! you knew, then, you were in disgrace with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! sire, I perceived it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you know the reason?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly well; your majesty thought that I had been wastefully lavish in
      expenditure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so; far from that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or, rather an indifferent administrator. In a word, you thought that, as
      the people had no money, there would be none for your majesty either."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I thought so; but I was deceived."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And no disturbances, no complaints?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And money enough," said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is that you have been profuse with it during the last month."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have more, not only for all your majesty's requirements, but for all
      your caprices."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you, Monsieur Fouquet," replied the king, seriously. "I will not
      put you to the proof. For the next two months I do not intend to ask you
      for anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will avail myself of the interval to amass five or six millions, which
      will be serviceable as money in hand in case of war."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five or six millions!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the expenses of your majesty's household only, be it understood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think war probable, M. Fouquet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think that if Heaven has bestowed on the eagle a beak and claws, it is
      to enable him to show his royal character."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king blushed with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have spent a great deal of money these few days past, Monsieur
      Fouquet; will you not scold me for it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, your majesty has still twenty years of youth to enjoy, and a
      thousand million francs to lavish in those twenty years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a great deal of money, M. Fouquet," said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will economize, sire. Besides, your majesty as two valuable servants in
      M. Colbert and myself. The one will encourage you to be prodigal with your
      treasures&mdash;and this shall be myself, if my services should continue
      to be agreeable to your majesty; and the other will economize money for
      you, and this will be M. Colbert's province."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. Colbert?" returned the king, astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, sire; M. Colbert is an excellent accountant."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this commendation, bestowed by the traduced on the traducer, the king
      felt himself penetrated with confidence and admiration. There was not,
      moreover, either in Fouquet's voice or look, anything which injuriously
      affected a single syllable of the remark he had made; he did not pass one
      eulogium, as it were, in order to acquire the right of making two
      reproaches. The king comprehended him, and yielding to so much generosity
      and address, he said, "You praise M. Colbert, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire, I praise him; for, besides being a man of merit, I believe him
      to be devoted to your majesty's interests."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that because he has often interfered with your own views?" said the
      king, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Explain yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is simple enough. I am the man who is needed to make the money come
      in; he is the man who is needed to prevent it leaving."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay, monsieur le surintendant, you will presently say something
      which will correct this good opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean as far as administrative abilities are concerned, sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in the slightest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my honor, sire, I do not know throughout France a better clerk than
      M. Colbert."
    </p>
    <p>
      This word "clerk" did not possess, in 1661, the somewhat subservient
      signification attached to it in the present day; but, as spoken by
      Fouquet, whom the king had addressed as the superintendent, it seemed to
      acquire an insignificant and petty character, that at this juncture served
      admirably to restore Fouquet to his place, and Colbert to his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet," said Louis XIV., "it was Colbert, however, that,
      notwithstanding his economy, had the arrangement of my <i>fetes</i> here
      at Fontainebleau; and I assure you, Monsieur Fouquet, that in no way has
      he checked the expenditure of money." Fouquet bowed, but did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not your opinion too?" said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think, sire," he replied, "that M. Colbert has done what he had to do
      in an exceedingly orderly manner, and that he deserves, in this respect,
      all the praise your majesty may bestow upon him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The word "orderly" was a proper accompaniment for the word "clerk." The
      king possessed that extreme sensitiveness of organization, that delicacy
      of perception, which pierced through and detected the regular order of
      feelings and sensations, before the actual sensations themselves, and he
      therefore comprehended that the clerk had, in Fouquet's opinion, been too
      full of method and order in his arrangements; in other words, that the
      magnificent <i>fetes</i> of Fontainebleau might have been rendered more
      magnificent still. The king consequently felt that there was something in
      the amusements he had provided with which some person or another might be
      able to find fault; he experienced a little of the annoyance felt by a
      person coming from the provinces to Paris, dressed out in the very best
      clothes which his wardrobe can furnish, only to find that the fashionably
      dressed man there looks at him either too much or not enough. This part of
      the conversation, which Fouquet had carried on with so much moderation,
      yet with extreme tact, inspired the king with the highest esteem for the
      character of the man and the capacity of the minister. Fouquet took his
      leave at a quarter to three in the morning, and the king went to bed a
      little uneasy and confused at the indirect lesson he had received; and a
      good hour was employed by him in going over again in memory the
      embroideries, the tapestries, the bills of fare of the various banquets,
      the architecture of the triumphal arches, the arrangements for the
      illuminations and fireworks, all the offspring of the "Clerk Colbert's"
      invention. The result was, the king passed in review before him everything
      that had taken place during the last eight days, and decided that faults
      could be found in his <i>fetes</i>. But Fouquet, by his politeness, his
      thoughtful consideration, and his generosity, had injured Colbert more
      deeply than the latter, by his artifice, his ill-will, and his persevering
      hatred, had ever yet succeeded in hurting Fouquet.

    <h2>
      Chapter XLVIII. Fontainebleau at Two o'Clock in the Morning.
    </h2>
    <p>
      As we have seen, Saint-Aignan had quitted the king's apartment at the very
      moment the superintendent entered it. Saint-Aignan was charged with a
      mission that required dispatch, and he was going to do his utmost to turn
      his time to the best advantage. He whom we have introduced as the king's
      friend was indeed an uncommon personage; he was one of those valuable
      courtiers whose vigilance and acuteness of perception threw all other
      favorites into the shade, and counterbalanced, by his close attention, the
      servility of Dangeau, who was not the favorite, but the toady of the king.
      M. de Saint-Aignan began to think what was to be done in the present
      position of affairs. He reflected that his first information ought to come
      from De Guiche. He therefore set out in search of him, but De Guiche, whom
      we saw disappear behind one of the wings, and who seemed to have returned
      to his own apartments, had not entered the chateau. Saint-Aignan therefore
      went in quest of him, and after having turned, and twisted, and searched
      in every direction, he perceived something like a human form leaning
      against a tree. This figure was as motionless as a statue, and seemed
      deeply engaged in looking at a window, although its curtains were closely
      drawn. As this window happened to be Madame's, Saint-Aignan concluded that
      the form in question must be that of De Guiche. He advanced cautiously,
      and found he was not mistaken. De Guiche had, after his conversation with
      Madame, carried away such a weight of happiness, that all of his strength
      of mind was hardly sufficient to enable him to support it. On his side,
      Saint-Aignan knew that De Guiche had had something to do with La
      Valliere's introduction to Madame's household, for a courtier knows
      everything and forgets nothing; but he had never learned under what title
      or conditions De Guiche had conferred his protection upon La Valliere.
      But, as in asking a great many questions it is singular if a man does not
      learn something, Saint-Aignan reckoned upon learning much or little, as
      the case might be, if he questioned De Guiche with that extreme tact, and,
      at the same time, with that persistence in attaining an object, of which
      he was capable. Saint-Aignan's plan was as follows: If the information
      obtained was satisfactory, he would inform the king, with alacrity, that
      he had lighted upon a pearl, and claim the privilege of setting the pearl
      in question in the royal crown. If the information were unsatisfactory,&mdash;which,
      after all, might be possible,&mdash;he would examine how far the king
      cared about La Valliere, and make use of his information in such a manner
      as to get rid of the girl altogether, and thereby obtain all the merit of
      her banishment with all the ladies of the court who might have the least
      pretensions to the king's heart, beginning with Madame and finishing with
      the queen. In case the king should show himself obstinate in his fancy,
      then he would not produce the damaging information he had obtained, but
      would let La Valliere know that this damaging information was carefully
      preserved in a secret drawer of her confidant's memory. In this manner, he
      would be able to air his generosity before the poor girl's eyes, and so
      keep her in constant suspense between gratitude and apprehension, to such
      an extent as to make her a friend at court, interested, as an accomplice,
      in trying to make his fortune, while she was making her own. As far as
      concerned the day when the bombshell of the past should burst, if ever
      there were any occasion, Saint-Aignan promised himself that he would by
      that time have taken all possible precautions, and would pretend an entire
      ignorance of the matter to the king; while, with regard to La Valliere, he
      would still have an opportunity of being considered the personification of
      generosity. It was with such ideas as these, which the fire of
      covetousness had caused to dawn in half an hour, that Saint-Aignan, the
      son of earth, as La Fontaine would have said, determined to get De Guiche
      into conversation: in other words, to trouble him in his happiness&mdash;a
      happiness of which Saint-Aignan was quite ignorant. It was long past one
      o'clock in the morning when Saint-Aignan perceived De Guiche, standing,
      motionless, leaning against the trunk of a tree, with his eyes fastened
      upon the lighted window,&mdash;the sleepiest hour of night-time, which
      painters crown with myrtles and budding poppies, the hour when eyes are
      heavy, hearts throb, and heads feel dull and languid&mdash;an hour which
      casts upon the day which has passed away a look of regret, while
      addressing a loving greeting to the dawning light. For De Guiche it was
      the dawn of unutterable happiness; he would have bestowed a treasure upon
      a beggar, had one stood before him, to secure him uninterrupted indulgence
      in his dreams. It was precisely at this hour that Saint-Aignan, badly
      advised,&mdash;selfishness always counsels badly,&mdash;came and struck
      him on the shoulder, at the very moment he was murmuring a word, or rather
      a name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" he cried loudly, "I was looking for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For me?" said De Guiche, starting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; and I find you seemingly moon-struck. Is it likely, my dear comte,
      you have been attacked by a poetical malady, and are making verses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man forced a smile upon his lips, while a thousand conflicting
      sensations were muttering defiance of Saint-Aignan in the deep recesses of
      his heart. "Perhaps," he said. "But by what happy chance&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! your remark shows that you did not hear what I said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I began by telling you I was looking for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were looking for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes: and I find you now in the very act."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of doing what, I should like to know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of singing the praises of Phyllis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I do not deny it," said De Guiche, laughing. "Yes, my dear comte, I
      was celebrating Phyllis's praises."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have acquired the right to do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You; no doubt of it. You; the intrepid protector of every beautiful and
      clever woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the name of goodness, what story have you got hold of now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Acknowledged truths, I am well aware. But stay a moment; I am in love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the better, my dear comte; tell me all about it." And De Guiche,
      afraid that Saint-Aignan might perhaps presently observe the window, where
      the light was still burning, took the comte's arm and endeavored to lead
      him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said the latter, resisting, "do not take me towards those dark
      woods, it is too damp there. Let us stay in the moonlight." And while he
      yielded to the pressure of De Guiche's arm, he remained in the
      flower-garden adjoining the chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said De Guiche, resigning himself, "lead me where you like, and
      ask me what you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is impossible to be more agreeable than you are." And then, after a
      moment's silence, Saint-Aignan continued, "I wish you to tell me something
      about a certain person in who you have interested yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And with whom you are in love?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will neither admit nor deny it. You understand that a man does not very
      readily place his heart where there is no hope of return, and that it is
      most essential he should take measures of security in advance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," said De Guiche with a sigh; "a man's heart is a very
      precious gift."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine particularly is very tender, and in that light I present it to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! you are well known, comte. Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is simply a question of Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, my dear Saint-Aignan, you are losing your senses, I should think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have never shown or taken any interest in Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you not obtain admission for Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente into
      Madame's household?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente&mdash;and you ought to know it better
      than any one else, my dear comte&mdash;is of a sufficiently good family to
      make her presence here desirable, and her admittance very easy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are jesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; and upon my honor I do not know what you mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you had nothing, then, to do with her admission?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not know her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw her for the first time the day she was presented to Madame.
      Therefore, as I have never taken any interest in her, as I do not know
      her, I am not able to give you the information you require." And De Guiche
      made a movement as though he were about to leave his questioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay, one moment, my dear comte," said Saint-Aignan; "you shall not
      escape me in this manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, really, it seems to me that it is now time to return to our
      apartments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet you were not going in when I&mdash;did not meet, but found you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Therefore, my dear comte," said De Guiche, "as long as you have anything
      to say to me, I place myself entirely at your service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are quite right in doing so. What matters half an hour more or
      less? Will you swear that you have no injurious communications to make to
      me about her, and that any injurious communications you might possibly
      have to make are not the cause of your silence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I believe the poor child to be as pure as crystal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You overwhelm me with joy. And yet I do not wish to have towards you the
      appearance of a man so badly informed as I seem. It is quite certain that
      you supplied the princess's household with the ladies of honor. Nay, a
      song has even been written about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! songs are written about everything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No: sing it to me and I shall make its acquaintance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot tell you how it begins; I only remember how it ends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, at all events, that is something."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When Maids of Honor happen to run short, Lo!&mdash;Guiche will furnish
      the entire Court."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The idea is weak, and the rhyme poor," said De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can you expect, my dear fellow? it is not Racine's or Moliere's, but
      La Feuillade's; and a great lord cannot rhyme like a beggarly poet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very unfortunate, though, that you only remember the termination."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay, stay, I have just recollected the beginning of the second couplet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, there's the birdcage, with a pretty pair, The charming Montalais,
      and..."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And La Valliere," exclaimed Guiche, impatiently, and completely ignorant
      besides of Saint-Aignan's object.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, you have it. You have hit upon the word, 'La Valliere.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A grand discovery indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Montalais and La Valliere, these, then, are the two young girls in whom
      you interest yourself," said Saint-Aignan, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente's name is not to be met with in
      the song?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And are you satisfied, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly; but I find Montalais there," said Saint-Aignan, still
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! you will find her everywhere. She is a singularly active young lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indirectly. She was the <i>protegee</i> of a man named Malicorne, who is
      a <i>protegee</i> of Manicamp's; Manicamp asked me to get the situation of
      maid of honor for Montalais in Madame's household, and a situation for
      Malicorne as an officer in Monsieur's household. Well, I asked for the
      appointments, for you know very well that I have a weakness for that droll
      fellow Manicamp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you obtained what you sought?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For Montalais, yes; for Malicorne, yes and no; for as yet he is only on
      trial. Do you wish to know anything else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The last word of the couplet still remains, La Valliere," said
      Saint-Aignan, resuming the smile that so tormented Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the latter, "it is true that I obtained admission for her in
      Madame's household."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," continued Guiche, assuming a great coldness of manner, "you will
      oblige me, comte, not to jest about that name. Mademoiselle la Baume le
      Blanc de la Valliere is a young lady perfectly well-conducted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly well-conducted do you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you have not heard the last rumor?" exclaimed Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, and you will do me a service, my dear comte, in keeping this report
      to yourself and to those who circulate it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! bah! you take the matter up very seriously."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; Mademoiselle de Valliere is beloved by one of my best friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan started. "Aha!" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, comte," continued Guiche; "and consequently, you, the most
      distinguished man in France for polished courtesy of manner, will
      understand that I cannot allow my friend to be placed in a ridiculous
      position."
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan began to bite his nails, partially from vexation, and
      partially from disappointed curiosity. Guiche made him a very profound
      bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You send me away," said Saint-Aignan, who was dying to know the name of
      the friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not send you away, my dear fellow. I am going to finish my lines to
      Phyllis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And those lines&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are a <i>quatrain</i>. You understand, I trust, that a <i>quatrain</i> is
      a serious affair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And as, of these four lines, of which it is composed, I have yet three
      and a half to make, I need my undivided attention."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I quite understand. Adieu! comte. By the by&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you quick at making verses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonderfully so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you have quite finished the three lines and a half to-morrow
      morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I <i>hope</i> so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adieu, then, until to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adieu, adieu!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan was obliged to accept the notice to quit; he accordingly did
      so, and disappeared behind the hedge. Their conversation had led Guiche
      and Saint-Aignan a good distance from the chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every mathematician, every poet, and every dreamer has his own subjects of
      interest. Saint-Aignan, on leaving Guiche, found himself at the extremity
      of the grove,&mdash;at the very spot where the outbuildings of the
      servants begin, and where, behind the thickets of acacias and
      chestnut-trees interlacing their branches, which were hidden by masses of
      clematis and young vines, the wall which separated the woods from the
      courtyard was erected. Saint-Aignan, alone, took the path which led
      towards these buildings; De Guiche going off in the opposite direction.
      The one proceeded to the flower-garden, while the other bent his steps
      towards the walls. Saint-Aignan walked on between rows of mountain-ash,
      lilac, and hawthorn, which formed an almost impenetrable roof above his
      head; his feet were buried in the soft gravel and thick moss. He was
      deliberating a means of taking his revenge, which seemed difficult for him
      to carry out, and was vexed with himself for not having learned more about
      La Valliere, notwithstanding the ingenious measures he had resorted to in
      order to acquire more information about her, when suddenly the murmur of a
      human voice attracted his attention. He heard whispers, the complaining
      tones of a woman's voice mingled with entreaties, smothered laughter,
      sighs, and half-stilted exclamations of surprise; but above them all, the
      woman's voice prevailed. Saint-Aignan stopped to look about him; he
      perceived from the greatest surprise that the voices proceeded, not from
      the ground, but from the branches of the trees. As he glided along under
      the covered walk, he raised his head, and observed at the top of the wall
      a woman perched upon a ladder, in eager conversation with a man seated on
      a branch of a chestnut-tree, whose head alone could be seen, the rest of
      his body being concealed in the thick covert of the chestnut. <a

    <h2>
      Chapter XLIX. The Labyrinth.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan, who had only been seeking for information, had met with an
      adventure. This was indeed a piece of good luck. Curious to learn why, and
      particularly what about, this man and woman were conversing at such an
      hour, and in such a singular position, Saint-Aignan made himself as small
      as he possibly could, and approached almost under the rounds of the
      ladder. And taking measures to make himself as comfortable as possible, he
      leaned his back against a tree and listened, and heard the following
      conversation. The woman was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, Monsieur Manicamp," she said, in a voice which, notwithstanding
      the reproaches she addressed to him, preserved a marked tone of coquetry,
      "really your indiscretion is of a very dangerous character. We cannot talk
      long in this manner without being observed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is very probable," said the man, in the calmest and coolest of
      tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, then, what would people say? Oh! if any one were to see me,
      I declare I should die of very shame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! that would be very silly; I do not believe you would."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might have been different if there had been anything between us; but
      to injure myself gratuitously is really very foolish of me; so, adieu,
      Monsieur Manicamp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far so good; I know the man, and now let me see who the woman is,"
      said Saint-Aignan, watching the rounds of the ladder, on which were
      standing two pretty little feet covered with blue satin shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay, for pity's sake, my dear Montalais," cried Manicamp, "deuce
      take it, do not go away; I have a great many things to say to you, of the
      greatest importance, still."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Montalais," said Saint-Aignan to himself, "one of the three. Each of the
      three gossips had her adventure, only I imagined the hero of this one's
      adventure was Malicorne and not Manicamp."
    </p>
    <p>
      At her companion's appeal, Montalais stopped in the middle of her descent,
      and Saint-Aignan could observe the unfortunate Manicamp climb from one
      branch of the chestnut-tree to another, either to improve his situation or
      to overcome the fatigue consequent upon his inconvenient position.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, listen to me," said he; "you quite understand, I hope, that my
      intentions are perfectly innocent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. But why did you write me a letter stimulating my gratitude
      towards you? Why did you ask me for an interview at such an hour and in
      such a place as this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I stimulated your gratitude in reminding you that it was I who had been
      the means of your becoming attached to Madame's household; because most
      anxiously desirous of obtaining the interview you have been kind enough to
      grant me, I employed the means which appeared to me most certain to insure
      it. And my reason for soliciting it, at such an hour and in such a
      locality, was, that the hour seemed to me to be the most prudent, and the
      locality the least open to observation. Moreover, I had occasion to speak
      to you upon certain subjects which require both prudence and solitude."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Manicamp!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But everything I wish to say is perfectly honorable, I assure you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think, Monsieur Manicamp, it will be more becoming in me to take my
      leave."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no!&mdash;listen to me, or I will jump from my perch here to yours;
      and be careful how you set me at defiance, for a branch of this
      chestnut-tree causes me a good deal of annoyance, and may provoke me to
      extreme measures. Do not follow the example of this branch, then, but
      listen to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am listening, and I agree to do so; but be as brief as possible, for if
      you have a branch of the chestnut-tree which annoys you, I wish you to
      understand that one of the rounds of the ladder is hurting the soles of my
      feet, and my shoes are being cut through."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do me the kindness to give me your hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you have the goodness to do so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is my hand, then; but what are you going to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To draw you towards me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for? You surely do not wish me to join you in the tree?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but I wish you to sit down upon the wall; there, that will do; there
      is quite room enough, and I would give a great deal to be allowed to sit
      down beside you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; you are very well where you are; we should be seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you really think so?" said Manicamp, in an insinuating voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, I remain in my tree, then, although I cannot be worse placed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Manicamp, we are wandering away from the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, we are so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wrote me a letter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you write?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fancy, at two o'clock to-day, De Guiche left."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seeing him set off, I followed him, as I usually do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, I see that, since you are here now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be in a hurry. You are aware, I suppose, that De Guiche is up to
      his very neck in disgrace?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was the very height of imprudence on his part, then, to come to
      Fontainebleau to seek those who had at Paris sent him away into exile, and
      particularly those from whom he had been separated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Manicamp, you reason like Pythagoras."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moreover, De Guiche is as obstinate as a man in love can be, and he
      refused to listen to any of my remonstrances. I begged, I implored him,
      but he would not listen to anything. Oh, the deuce!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon, Mademoiselle Montalais, but this confounded branch,
      about which I have already had the honor of speaking to you, has just torn
      a certain portion of my dress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is quite dark," replied Montalais, laughing; "so, pray continue, M.
      Manicamp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "De Guiche set off on horseback as hard as he could, I following him, at a
      slower pace. You quite understand that to throw one's self into the water,
      for instance, with a friend, at the same headlong rate as he himself would
      do it, would be the act either of a fool or a madman. I therefore allowed
      De Guiche to get in advance, and I proceeded on my way with a commendable
      slowness of pace, feeling quite sure that my unfortunate friend would not
      be received, or, if he had been, that he would ride off again at the very
      first cross, disagreeable answer; and that I should see him returning much
      faster than he went, without having, myself, gone much farther than Ris or
      Melun&mdash;and that even was a good distance you will admit, for it is
      eleven leagues to get there and as many to return."
    </p>
    <p>
      Montalais shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Laugh as much as you like; but if, instead of being comfortably seated on
      the top of the wall as you are, you were sitting on this branch as if you
      were on horseback, you would, like Augustus, aspire to descend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be patient, my dear M. Manicamp; a few minutes will soon pass away; you
      were saying, I think, that you had gone beyond Ris and Melun."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I went through Ris and Melun, and I continued to go on, more and
      more surprised that I did not see him returning; and here I am at
      Fontainebleau; I look for and inquire after De Guiche everywhere, but no
      one has seen him, no one in the town has spoken to him; he arrived riding
      at full gallop, he entered the chateau; and there he has disappeared. I
      have been here at Fontainebleau since eight o'clock this evening inquiring
      for De Guiche in every direction, but no De Guiche can be found. I am
      dying with uneasiness. You understand that I have not been running my head
      into the lion's den, in entering the chateau, as my imprudent friend has
      done; I came at once to the servants' offices, and I succeeded in getting
      a letter conveyed to you; and now, for Heaven's sake, my dear young lady,
      relieve me from my anxiety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will be no difficulty in that, my dear M. Manicamp; your friend De
      Guiche has been admirably received."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king made quite a fuss over him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king, who exiled him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame smiled upon him, and Monsieur appears to like him better than
      ever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! ah!" said Manicamp, "that explains to me, then, why and how he has
      remained. And did he not say anything about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is very unkind. What is he doing now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In all probability he is asleep, or, if not asleep, dreaming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what have they been doing all the evening?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dancing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The famous ballet? How did De Guiche look?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Superb!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear fellow! And now, pray forgive me, Mademoiselle Montalais; but all I
      now have to do is pass from where I now am to your apartment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot suppose that the door of the chateau will be opened for me at
      this hour; and as for spending the night upon this branch, I possibly
      might not object to do so, but I declare it is impossible for any other
      animal than a boa-constrictor to do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, M. Manicamp, I cannot introduce a man over the wall in that manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two, if you please," said a second voice, but in so timid a tone that it
      seemed as if its owner felt the utter impropriety of such a request.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good gracious!" exclaimed Montalais, "who is that speaking to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Malicorne, Mademoiselle Montalais."
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Malicorne spoke, he raised himself from the ground to the lowest
      branches, and thence to the height of the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Malicorne! why, you are both mad!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you do, Mademoiselle Montalais?" inquired Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I needed but this!" said Montalais, in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Mademoiselle Montalais," murmured Malicorne; "do not be so severe, I
      beseech you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In fact," said Manicamp, "we are your friends, and you cannot possibly
      wish your friends to lose their lives; and to leave us to pass the night
      on these branches is in fact condemning us to death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Montalais, "Monsieur Malicorne is so robust that a night passed
      in the open air with the beautiful stars above him will not do him any
      harm, and it will be a just punishment for the trick he has played me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so, then; let Malicorne arrange matters with you in the best way he
      can; I pass over," said Manicamp. And bending down the famous branch
      against which he had directed such bitter complaints, he succeeded, by the
      assistance of his hands and feet, in seating himself side by side with
      Montalais, who tried to push him back, while he endeavored to maintain his
      position, and, moreover, he succeeded. Having taken possession of the
      ladder, he stepped on it, and then gallantly offered his hand to his fair
      antagonist. While this was going on, Malicorne had installed himself in
      the chestnut-tree, in the very place Manicamp had just left, determining
      within himself to succeed him in the one he now occupied. Manicamp and
      Montalais descended a few rounds of the ladder, Manicamp insisting, and
      Montalais laughing and objecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Malicorne's voice was heard in tones of entreaty:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I entreat you, Mademoiselle Montalais, not to leave me here. My position
      is very insecure, and some accident will be certain to befall me, if I
      attempt unaided to reach the other side of the wall; it does not matter if
      Manicamp tears his clothes, for he can make use of M. de Guiche's
      wardrobe; but I shall not be able to use even those belonging to M.
      Manicamp, for they will be torn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My opinion," said Manicamp, without taking any notice of Malicorne's
      lamentations, "is that the best thing to be done is to go and look for De
      Guiche without delay, for, by and by, perhaps, I may not be able to get to
      his apartments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is my own opinion, too," replied Montalais; "so, go at once,
      Monsieur Manicamp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thousand thanks. Adieu Mademoiselle Montalais," said Manicamp, jumping
      to the ground; "your condescension cannot be repaid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell, M. Manicamp; I am now going to get rid of M. Malicorne."
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne sighed. Manicamp went away a few paces, but returning to the
      foot of the ladder, he said, "By the by, how do I get to M. de Guiche's
      apartments?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing easier. You go along by the hedge until you reach a place where
      the paths cross."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will see four paths."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of which you will take."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That to the right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That to the right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, to the left."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The deuce!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, wait a minute&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not seem to be quite sure. Think again, I beg."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You take the middle path."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there are <i>four</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So there are. All I know is, that one of the four paths leads straight to
      Madame's apartments; and that one I am well acquainted with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But M. de Guiche is not in Madame's apartments, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then the path which leads to Madame's apartments is of no use to
      me, and I would willingly exchange it for the one that leads to where M.
      de Guiche is lodging."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, and I know that as well; but as for indicating it from where
      we are, it is quite impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, let us suppose that I have succeeded in finding that fortunate
      path."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, you are almost there, for you have nothing else to do but
      cross the labyrinth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Nothing</i> more than that? The deuce! so there is a labyrinth as
      well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and complicated enough too; even in daylight one may sometimes be
      deceived,&mdash;there are turnings and windings without end: in the first
      place, you must turn three times to the right, then twice to the left,
      then turn once&mdash;stay, is it once or twice, though? at all events,
      when you get clear of the labyrinth, you will see an avenue of sycamores,
      and this avenue leads straight to the pavilion in which M. de Guiche is
      lodging."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing could be more clearly indicated," said Manicamp; "and I have not
      the slightest doubt in the world that if I were to follow your directions,
      I should lose my way immediately. I have, therefore, a slight service to
      ask of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What may that be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you will offer me your arm and guide me yourself, like another&mdash;
      like another&mdash;I used to know mythology, but other important matters
      have made me forget it; pray come with me, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And am I to be abandoned, then?" cried Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is quite impossible, monsieur," said Montalais to Manicamp; "if I were
      to be seen with you at such an hour, what would be said of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your own conscience would acquit you," said Manicamp, sententiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible, monsieur, impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, let me assist Malicorne to get down; he is a very
      intelligent fellow, and possesses a very keen scent; he will guide me, and
      if we lose ourselves, both of us will be lost, and the one will save the
      other. If we are together, and should be met by any one, we shall look as
      if we had some matter of business in hand; whilst alone I should have the
      appearance either of a lover or a robber. Come, Malicorne, here is the
      ladder."
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne had already stretched out one of his legs towards the top of the
      wall, when Manicamp said, in a whisper, "Hush!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter?" inquired Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear footsteps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact the fancied footsteps soon became a reality; the foliage was
      pushed aside, and Saint-Aignan appeared, with a smile on his lips, and his
      hand stretched out towards them, taking every one by surprise; that is to
      say, Malicorne upon the tree with his head stretched out, Montalais upon
      the round of the ladder and clinging to it tightly, and Manicamp on the
      ground with his foot advanced ready to set off. "Good-evening, Manicamp,"
      said the comte, "I am glad to see you, my dear fellow; we missed you this
      evening, and a good many inquiries have been made about you. Mademoiselle
      de Montalais, your most obedient servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      Montalais blushed. "Good heavens!" she exclaimed, hiding her face in both
      her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray reassure yourself; I know how perfectly innocent you are, and I
      shall give a good account of you. Manicamp, do you follow me: the hedge,
      the cross-paths, and labyrinth, I am well acquainted with them all; I will
      be your Ariadne. There now, your mythological name is found at last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly true, comte."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And take M. Malicorne away with you at the same time," said Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed," said Malicorne; "M. Manicamp has conversed with you as long
      as he liked, and now it is my turn, if you please; I have a multitude of
      things to tell you about our future prospects."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hear," said the comte, laughing; "stay with him, Mademoiselle
      Montalais. This is, indeed, a night for secrets." And, taking Manicamp's
      arm, the comte led him rapidly away in the direction of the road Montalais
      knew so well, and indicated so badly. Montalais followed them with her
      eyes as long as she could perceive them.

    <h2>
      Chapter L: How Malicorne Had Been Turned Out of the Hotel of the Beau
      Paon.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While Montalais was engaged in looking after the comte and Manicamp,
      Malicorne had taken advantage of the young girl's attention being drawn
      away to render his position somewhat more tolerable, and when she turned
      round, she immediately noticed the change which had taken place; for he
      had seated himself, like a monkey, upon the wall, the foliage of the wild
      vine and honeysuckle curled around his head like a faun, while the twisted
      ivy branches represented tolerably enough his cloven feet. Montalais
      required nothing to make her resemblance to a dryad as complete as
      possible. "Well," she said, ascending another round of the ladder, "are
      you resolved to render me unhappy? have you not persecuted me enough,
      tyrant that you are?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I a tyrant?" said Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you are always compromising me, Monsieur Malicorne; you are a
      perfect monster of wickedness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you to do with Fontainebleau? Is not Orleans your place of
      residence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you ask me what I have to do here? I wanted to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, great need of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not as far as concerns yourself, perhaps, but as far as I am concerned,
      Mademoiselle Montalais, you know very well that I have left my home, and
      that, for the future, I have no other place of residence than that which
      you may happen to have. As you, therefore, are staying at Fontainebleau at
      the present moment, I have come to Fontainebleau."
    </p>
    <p>
      Montalais shrugged her shoulders. "You wished to see me, did you not?" she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, you have seen me,&mdash;you are satisfied; so now go away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no," said Malicorne; "I came to talk with you as well as to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, we will talk by and by, and in another place than this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By and by! Heaven only knows if I shall meet you by and by in another
      place. We shall never find a more favorable one than this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I cannot this evening, nor at the present moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because a thousand things have happened to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, my affair will make a thousand and one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente is waiting for me in our room to
      communicate something of the very greatest importance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long has she been waiting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For an hour at least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case," said Malicorne, tranquilly, "she can wait a few minutes
      longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Malicorne," said Montalais, "you are forgetting yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should rather say that it is you who are forgetting me, and that I am
      getting impatient at the part you make me play here indeed! For the last
      week I have been prowling about among the company, and you have not once
      deigned to notice my presence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you been prowling about here for a week, M. Malicorne?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like a wolf; sometimes I have been burnt by the fireworks, which have
      singed two of my wigs; at others, I have been completely drenched in the
      osiers by the evening damps, or the spray from the fountains,&mdash;half-famished,
      fatigued to death, with the view of a wall always before me, and the
      prospect of having to scale it perhaps. Upon my word, this is not the sort
      of life for any one to lead who is neither a squirrel, a salamander, nor
      an otter; and since you drive your inhumanity so far as to wish to make me
      renounce my condition as a man, I declare it openly. A man I am, indeed,
      and a man I will remain, unless by superior orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, tell me, what do you wish,&mdash;what do you require,&mdash;what
      do you insist upon?" said Montalais, in a submissive tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to tell me that you did not know I was at Fontainebleau?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, be frank."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suspected so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, could you not have contrived during the last week to have
      seen me once a day, at least?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have always been prevented, M. Malicorne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fiddlesticks!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask my companion, if you do not believe me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall ask no one to explain matters, I know better than any one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Compose yourself, M. Malicorne: things will change."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They must indeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know that, whether I see you or not, I am thinking of you," said
      Montalais, in a coaxing tone of voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you are thinking of me, are you? well, and is there anything new?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About my post in Monsieur's household."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my dear Malicorne, no one has ventured lately to approach his royal
      highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, but now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now it is quite a different thing; since yesterday he has left off being
      jealous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah! how has his jealousy subsided?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It has been diverted into another channel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me all about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A report was spread that the king had fallen in love with some one else,
      and Monsieur was tranquillized immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who spread the report?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Montalais lowered her voice. "Between ourselves," she said, "I think that
      Madame and the king have come to a secret understanding about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Malicorne; "that was the only way to manage it. But what about
      poor M. de Guiche?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, as for him, he is completely turned off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have they been writing to each other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, certainly not; I have not seen a pen in either of their hands for the
      last week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On what terms are you with Madame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And with the king?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king always smiles at me whenever I pass him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. Now tell me whom have the two lovers selected to serve as their
      screen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "La Valliere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, oh, poor girl! We must prevent that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, if M. Raoul Bragelonne were to suspect it, he would either kill
      her or kill himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Raoul, poor fellow! do you think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Women pretend to have a knowledge of the state of people's affections,"
      said Malicorne, "and they do not even know how to read the thoughts of
      their own minds and hearts. Well, I can tell you that M. de Bragelonne
      loves La Valliere to such a degree that, if she deceived him, he would, I
      repeat, either kill himself or kill her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the king is there to defend her," said Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king!" exclaimed Malicorne; "Raoul would kill the king as he would a
      common thief."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens!" said Montalais; "you are mad, M. Malicorne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in the least. Everything I have told you is, on the contrary,
      perfectly serious; and, for my own part, I know one thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I shall quietly tell Raoul of the trick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush!" said Montalais, mounting another round of the ladder, so as to
      approach Malicorne more closely, "do not open your lips to poor Raoul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, as yet you know nothing at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, this evening&mdash;but no one is listening, I hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This evening, then, beneath the royal oak, La Valliere said aloud, and
      innocently enough, 'I cannot conceive that when one has once seen the
      king, one can ever love another man.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne almost jumped off the wall. "Unhappy girl! did she really say
      that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Word for word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she thinks so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "La Valliere always thinks what she says."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That positively cries aloud for vengeance. Why, women are the veriest
      serpents," said Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Compose yourself, my dear Malicorne, compose yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no; let us take the evil in time, on the contrary. There is time
      enough yet to tell Raoul of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blunderer, on the contrary, it is too late," replied Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "La Valliere's remark, which was intended for the king, reached its
      destination."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king knows it, then? The king was told of it, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king heard it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Ahime!</i> as the cardinal used to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king was hidden in the thicket close to the royal oak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It follows, then," said Malicorne, "that for the future, the plan which
      the king and Madame have arranged, will go as easily as if it were on
      wheels, and will pass over poor Bragelonne's body."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Malicorne, after a moment's reflection, "do not let us
      interpose our poor selves between a large oak-tree and a great king, for
      we should certainly be ground to pieces."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The very thing I was going to say to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us think of ourselves, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My own idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open your beautiful eyes, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you your large ears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Approach your little mouth for a kiss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here," said Montalais, who paid the debt immediately in ringing coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now let us consider. First, we have M. de Guiche, who is in love with
      Madame; then La Valliere, who is in love with the king; next, the king,
      who is in love both with Madame and La Valliere; lastly Monsieur, who
      loves no one but himself. Among all these loves, a noodle would make his
      fortune: a greater reason, therefore, for sensible people like ourselves
      to do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There you are with your dreams again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, rather with realities. Let me still lead you, darling. I do not
      think you have been very badly off hitherto?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the future is guaranteed by the past. Only, since all here think of
      themselves before anything else, let us do so too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But of ourselves only."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An offensive and defensive alliance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am ready to swear it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put out your hand, then, and say, 'All for Malicorne.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All for Malicorne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I, 'All for Montalais,'" replied Malicorne, stretching out his hand
      in his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, what is to be done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep your eyes and ears constantly open; collect every means of attack
      which may be serviceable against others; never let anything lie about
      which can be used against ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Agreed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Decided."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sworn to. And now the agreement entered into, good-bye."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by 'good-bye?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course you can now return to your inn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To my inn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; are you not lodging at the sign of the Beau Paon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Montalais, Montalais, you now betray that you were aware of my being at
      Fontainebleau."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well; and what does that prove, except that I occupy myself about you
      more than you deserve?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go back, then, to the Beau Paon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is now quite out of the question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you not a room there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had, but have it no longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who has taken it from you, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you. Some little time ago I was returning there, after I had
      been running about after you; and having reached my hotel quite out of
      breath, I perceived a litter, upon which four peasants were carrying a
      sick monk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A monk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, an old gray-bearded Franciscan. As I was looking at the monk, they
      entered the hotel; and as they were carrying him up the staircase, I
      followed, and as I reached the top of the staircase I observed that they
      took him into my room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Into your room?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, into my own apartment. Supposing it to be a mistake, I summoned the
      landlord, who said that the room which had been let to me for the past
      eight days was let to the Franciscan for the ninth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, oh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was exactly what I said; nay, I did even more, for I was inclined to
      get out of temper. I went up-stairs again. I spoke to the Franciscan
      himself, and wished to prove to him the impropriety of the step; when this
      monk, dying though he seemed to be, raised himself upon his arm, fixed a
      pair of blazing eyes upon me, and, in a voice which was admirably suited
      for commanding a charge of cavalry, said, 'Turn this fellow out of doors;'
      which was done, immediately by the landlord and the four porters, who made
      me descend the staircase somewhat faster than was agreeable. This is how
      it happens, dearest, that I have no lodging."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who can this Franciscan be?" said Montalais. "Is he a general?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is exactly the very title that one of the bearers of the litter gave
      him as he spoke to him in a low tone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that&mdash;" said Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that I have no room, no hotel, no lodging; and I am as determined as
      my friend Manicamp was just now, not to pass the night in the open air."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is to be done, then?" said Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing easier," said a third voice; whereupon Montalais and Malicorne
      uttered a simultaneous cry, and Saint-Aignan appeared. "Dear Monsieur
      Malicorne," said Saint-Aignan, "a very lucky accident has brought me back
      to extricate you from your embarrassment. Come, I can offer you a room in
      my own apartments, which, I can assure you, no Franciscan will deprive you
      of. As for you, my dear lady, rest easy. I already knew Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere's secret, and that of Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente; your own
      you have just been kind enough to confide to me; for which I thank you. I
      can keep three quite as well as one." Malicorne and Montalais looked at
      each other, like children detected in a theft; but as Malicorne saw a
      great advantage in the proposition which had been made to him, he gave
      Montalais a sign of assent, which she returned. Malicorne then descended
      the ladder, round by round, reflecting at every step on the means of
      obtaining piecemeal from M. de Saint-Aignan all he might possibly know
      about the famous secret. Montalais had already darted away like a deer,
      and neither cross-road nor labyrinth was able to lead her wrong. As for
      Saint-Aignan, he carried off Malicorne with him to his apartments, showing
      him a thousand attentions, enchanted to have so close at hand the very two
      men who, even supposing De Guiche were to remain silent, could give him
      the best information about the maids of honor.

      Chapter LI. What Actually Occurred at the Inn Called the Beau Paon.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the first place, let us supply our readers with a few details about the
      inn called Beau Paon. It owed its name to its sign, which represented a
      peacock spreading its tail. But, in imitation of certain painters who
      bestowed the face of a handsome young man on the serpent which tempted
      Eve, the limner of the sign had conferred upon the peacock the features of
      a woman. This famous inn, an architectural epigram against that half of
      the human race which renders existence delightful, was situated at
      Fontainebleau, in the first turning on the left-hand side, which divides
      the road from Paris, the large artery that constitutes in itself alone the
      entire town of Fontainebleau. The side street in question was then known
      as the Rue de Lyon, doubtless because, geographically, it led in the
      direction of the second capital of the kingdom. The street itself was
      composed of two houses occupied by persons of the class of tradespeople,
      the houses being separated by two large gardens bordered with hedges
      running round them. Apparently, however, there were three houses in the
      street. Let us explain, notwithstanding appearances, how there were in
      fact only two. The inn of the Beau Paon had its principal front towards
      the main street; but upon the Rue de Lyon there were two ranges of
      buildings divided by courtyards, which comprised sets of apartments for
      the reception of all classes of travelers, whether on foot or on
      horseback, or even with their own carriages; and in which could be
      supplied, not only board and lodging, but also accommodation for exercise,
      or opportunities of solitude for even the wealthiest courtiers, whenever,
      after having received some check at the court, they wished to shut
      themselves up to their own society, either to devour an affront, or to
      brood on revenge. From the windows of this part of the building travelers
      could perceive, in the first place, the street with the grass growing
      between the stones, which were being gradually loosened by it; next the
      beautiful hedges of elder and thorn, which embraced, as though within two
      green and flowery arms, the house of which we have spoken; and then, in
      the spaces between those houses, forming the groundwork of the picture,
      and appearing an almost impassable barrier, a line of thick trees, the
      advanced sentinels of the vast forest which extends in front of
      Fontainebleau. It was therefore easy, provided one secured an apartment at
      the angle of the building, to obtain, by the main street from Paris, a
      view of, as well as to hear, the passers-by and the <i>fetes</i>; and, by
      the Rue de Lyon, to look upon and to enjoy the calm of the country. And
      this without reckoning that, in cases of urgent necessity, at the very
      moment people might be knocking at the principal door in the Rue de Paris,
      one could make one's escape by the little door in the Rue de Lyon, and,
      creeping along the gardens of the private houses, attain the outskirts of
      the forest. Malicorne, who, it will be remembered, was the first to speak
      about this inn, by way of deploring his being turned out of it, being then
      absorbed in his own affairs, had not told Montalais all that could be said
      about this curious inn; and we will try to repair the omission. With the
      exception of the few words he had said about the Franciscan friar,
      Malicorne had not given any particulars about the travelers who were
      staying in the inn. The manner in which they had arrived, the manner in
      which they had lived, the difficulty which existed for every one but
      certain privileged travelers, of entering the hotel without a password, or
      living there without certain preparatory precautions, must have struck
      Malicorne; and, we will venture to say, really did so. But Malicorne, as
      we have already said, had personal matters of his own to occupy his
      attention which prevented him from paying much attention to others. In
      fact, all the apartments of the hotel were engaged and retained by certain
      strangers, who never stirred out, who were incommunicative in their
      address, with countenances full of thoughtful preoccupation, and not one
      of whom was known to Malicorne. Every one of these travelers had reached
      the hotel after his own arrival there; each man had entered after having
      given a kind of password, which had at first attracted Malicorne's
      attention; but having inquired, in an indiscreet manner, about it, he had
      been informed that the host had given as a reason for this extreme
      vigilance, that, as the town was so full of wealthy noblemen, it must also
      be as full of clever and zealous pickpockets. The reputation of an honest
      inn like that of the Beau Paon was concerned in not allowing its visitors
      to be robbed. It occasionally happened that Malicorne asked himself, as he
      thought matters carefully over in his mind, and reflected upon his own
      position in the inn, how it was that they had allowed him to become an
      inmate of the hotel, when he had observed, since his residence there,
      admission refused to so many. He asked himself, too, how it was that
      Manicamp, who, in his opinion, must be a man to be looked upon with
      veneration by everybody, having wished to bait his horse at the Beau Paon,
      on arriving there, both horse and rider had been incontinently turned away
      with a <i>nescio vos</i> of the most positive character. All this for
      Malicorne, whose mind being fully occupied by his own love affair and
      personal ambition, was a problem he had not applied himself to solve. Had
      he wished to do so, we should hardly venture, notwithstanding the
      intelligence we have accorded as his due, to say he would have succeeded.
      A few words will prove to the reader that no one but Oedipus in person
      could have solved the enigma in question. During the week, seven travelers
      had taken up their abode in the inn, all of them having arrived there the
      day after the fortunate day on which Malicorne had fixed his choice on the
      Beau Paon. These seven persons, accompanied by a suitable retinue, were
      the following:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, a brigadier in the German army, his secretary, physician,
      three servants, and seven horses. The brigadier's name was the Comte de
      Wostpur.&mdash;A Spanish cardinal, with two nephews, two secretaries, an
      officer of his household, and twelve horses. The cardinal's name was
      Monseigneur Herrebia.&mdash;A rich merchant of Bremen, with his
      man-servant and two horses. This merchant's name was Meinheer Bonstett.&mdash;A
      Venetian senator with his wife and daughter, both extremely beautiful. The
      senator's name was Signor Marini.&mdash;A Scottish laird, with seven
      highlanders of his clan, all on foot. The laird's name was MacCumnor.&mdash;
      An Austrian from Vienna without title or coat of arms, who had arrived in
      a carriage; a good deal of the priest, and something of the soldier. He
      was called the Councilor.&mdash;And, finally, a Flemish lady, with a
      man-servant, a lady's maid, and a female companion, a large retinue of
      servants, great display, and immense horses. She was called the Flemish
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these travelers had arrived on the same day, and yet their arrival had
      occasioned no confusion in the inn, no stoppage in the street; their
      apartments had been fixed upon beforehand, by their couriers or
      secretaries, who had arrived the previous evening or that very morning.
      Malicorne, who had arrived the previous day, riding an ill-conditioned
      horse, with a slender valise, had announced himself at the hotel of the
      Beau Paon as the friend of a nobleman desirous of witnessing the <i>fetes</i>,
      and who would himself arrive almost immediately. The landlord, on hearing
      these words, had smiled as if he were perfectly well acquainted either
      with Malicorne or his friend the nobleman, and had said to him, "Since you
      are the first arrival, monsieur, choose what apartment you please." And
      this was said with that obsequiousness of manners, so full of meaning with
      landlords, which means, "Make yourself perfectly easy, monsieur: we know
      with whom we have to do, and you will be treated accordingly." These
      words, and their accompanying gesture, Malicorne had thought very
      friendly, but rather obscure. However, as he did not wish to be very
      extravagant in his expenses, and as he thought that if he were to ask for
      a small apartment he would doubtless have been refused, on account of his
      want of consequence, he hastened to close at once with the innkeeper's
      remark, and deceive him with a cunning equal to his own. So, smiling as a
      man would do for whom whatever might be done was but simply his due, he
      said, "My dear host, I shall take the best and the gayest room in the
      house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With a stable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, with a stable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when will you take it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Immediately if it be possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said Malicorne, "I shall leave the large room unoccupied for the
      present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good!" said the landlord, with an air of intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certain reasons, which you will understand by and by, oblige me to take,
      at my own cost, this small room only."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes," said the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When my friend arrives, he will occupy the large apartment: and as a
      matter of course, as this larger apartment will be his own affair, he will
      settle for it himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said the landlord, "certainly; let it be understood in that
      manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is agreed, then, that such shall be the terms?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Word for word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is extraordinary," said Malicorne to himself. "You quite understand,
      then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing more to be said. Since you understand,&mdash;for you do
      clearly understand, do you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; and now show me to my room."
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord, cap in hand, preceded Malicorne, who installed himself in
      his room, and became more and more surprised to observe that the landlord,
      at every ascent or descent, looked and winked at him in a manner which
      indicated the best possible intelligence between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is some mistake here," said Malicorne to himself; "but until it is
      cleared up, I shall take advantage of it, which is the best thing I can
      possibly do." And he darted out of his room, like a hunting-dog following
      a scent, in search of all the news and curiosities of the court, getting
      himself burnt in one place and drowned in another, as he had told
      Mademoiselle de Montalais. The day after he had been installed in his
      room, he had noticed the seven travelers arrive successively, who speedily
      filled the whole hotel. When he saw this perfect multitude of people, of
      carriages, and retinue, Malicorne rubbed his hands delightedly, thinking
      that, one day later, he should not have found a bed to lie upon after his
      return from his exploring expeditions. When all the travelers were lodged,
      the landlord entered Malicorne's room, and with his accustomed
      courteousness, said to him, "You are aware, my dear monsieur, that the
      large room in the third detached building is still reserved for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I am aware of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am really making you a present of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that when your friend comes&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will be satisfied with me, I hope: or, if he be not, he will be very
      difficult to please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, but will you allow me to say a few words about my friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, for you have a perfect right to do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He intended to come, as you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he does so still."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He may possibly have changed his opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite sure, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But in case you should have some doubt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can only say that I do not positively assure you that he will come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet he told you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He certainly did tell me; but you know that man proposes and God
      disposes,&mdash;<i>verba volant, scripta manent</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which is as much to say&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That what is spoken flies away, and what is written remains; and, as he
      did not write to me, but contented himself by saying to me, 'I will
      authorize you, yet without specifically instructing you,' you must feel
      that it places me in a very embarrassing position."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you authorize me to do, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, to let your rooms if you find a good tenant for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never will I do such a thing, monsieur. If he has not written to you, he
      has written to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! what does he say? Let us see if his letter agrees with his words."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These are almost his very words. 'To the landlord of the Beau Paon Hotel,&mdash;You
      will have been informed of the meeting arranged to take place in your inn
      between some people of importance; I shall be one of those who will meet
      with the others at Fontainebleau. Keep for me, then, a small room for a
      friend who will arrive either before or after me&mdash;' and you are the
      friend, I suppose," said the landlord, interrupting his reading of the
      letter. Malicorne bowed modestly. The landlord continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'And a large apartment for myself. The large apartment is my own affair,
      but I wish the price of the smaller room to be moderate, as it is destined
      for a fellow who is deucedly poor.' It is still you he is speaking of, is
      he not?" said the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, certainly," said Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we are agreed; your friend will settle for his apartment, and you
      for your own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I be broken alive on the wheel," said Malicorne to himself, "if I
      understand anything at all about it," and then he said aloud, "Well, then,
      are you satisfied with the name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With what name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With the name at the end of the letter. Does it give you the guarantee
      you require?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was going to ask you the name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! was the letter not signed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the landlord, opening his eyes very wide, full of mystery and
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case," said Malicorne, imitating his gesture and his mysterious
      look, "if he has not given you his name, you understand, he must have his
      reasons for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, therefore, I, his friend, his confidant, must not betray him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are perfectly right, monsieur," said the landlord, "and I do not
      insist upon it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I appreciate your delicacy. As for myself, as my friend told you, my room
      is a separate affair, so let us come to terms about it. Short accounts
      make long friends. How much is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no hurry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind, let us reckon it all up all the same. Room, my own board, a
      place in the stable for my horse, and his feed. How much per day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Four livres, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which will make twelve livres for the three days I have been here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here are your twelve livres, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why settle now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because," said Malicorne, lowering his voice, and resorting to his former
      air of mystery, because he saw that the mysterious had succeeded, "because
      if I had to set off suddenly, to decamp at any moment, my account would be
      settled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may consider myself at home, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perfectly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So far so well. Adieu!" And the landlord withdrew. Malicorne, left alone,
      reasoned with himself in the following manner: "No one but De Guiche or
      Manicamp could have written to this fellow; De Guiche, because he wishes
      to secure a lodging for himself beyond the precincts of the court, in the
      event of his success or failure, as the case might be; Manicamp, because
      De Guiche must have intrusted him with his commission. And De Guiche or
      Manicamp will have argued in this manner. The large apartment would serve
      for the reception, in a befitting manner, of a lady thickly veiled,
      reserving to the lady in question a double means of exit, either in a
      street somewhat deserted, or closely adjoining the forest. The smaller
      room might either shelter Manicamp for a time, who is De Guiche's
      confidant, and would be the vigilant keeper of the door, or De Guiche
      himself, acting, for greater safety, the part of a master and confidant at
      the same time. Yet," he continued, "how about this meeting which is to
      take place, and which has actually taken place, in this hotel? No doubt
      they are persons who are going to be presented to the king. And the 'poor
      devil,' for whom the smaller room is destined, is a trick, in order to
      better conceal De Guiche or Manicamp. If this be the case, as very likely
      it is, there is only half the mischief done, for there is simply the
      length of a purse string between Manicamp and Malicorne." After he had
      thus reasoned the matter out, Malicorne slept soundly, leaving the seven
      travelers to occupy, and in every sense of the word to walk up and down,
      their several lodgings in the hotel. Whenever there was nothing at court
      to put him out, when he had wearied himself with his excursions and
      investigations, tired of writing letters which he could never find an
      opportunity of delivering to the people they were intended for, he
      returned home to his comfortable little room, and leaning upon the
      balcony, which was filled with nasturtiums and white pinks, for whom
      Fontainebleau seemed to possess no attractions with all its illuminations,
      amusements, and <i>fetes</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things went on in this manner until the seventh day, a day of which we
      have given such full details, with its night also, in the preceding
      chapters. On that night Malicorne was enjoying the fresh air, seated at
      his window, toward one o'clock in the morning, when Manicamp appeared on
      horseback, with a thoughtful and listless air.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good!" said Malicorne to himself, recognizing him at the first glance;
      "there's my friend, who is come to take possession of his apartment, that
      is to say, of my room." And he called to Manicamp, who looked up and
      immediately recognized Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! by Jove!" said the former, his countenance clearing up, "glad to see
      you, Malicorne. I have been wandering about Fontainebleau, looking for
      three things I cannot find: De Guiche, a room, and a stable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of M. de Guiche I cannot give you either good or bad news, for I have not
      seen him; but as far as concerns your room and a stable, that's another
      matter, for they have been retained here for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Retained&mdash;and by whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By yourself, I presume."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By <i>me?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mean to say you did not take lodgings here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By no means," said Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the landlord appeared on the threshold of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want a room," said Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you engage one, monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I have no rooms to let."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, I have engaged a room," said Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A room simply, or lodgings?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anything you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By letter?" inquired the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne nodded affirmatively to Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course by letter," said Manicamp. "Did you not receive a letter from
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was the date of the letter?" inquired the host, in whom Manicamp's
      hesitation had aroused some suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp rubbed his ear, and looked up at Malicorne's window; but
      Malicorne had left his window and was coming down the stairs to his
      friend's assistance. At the very same moment, a traveler, wrapped in a
      large Spanish cloak, appeared at the porch, near enough to hear the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ask you what was the date of the letter you wrote to me to retain
      apartments here?" repeated the landlord, pressing the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Last Wednesday was the date," said the mysterious stranger, in a soft and
      polished tone of voice, touching the landlord on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp drew back, and it was now Malicorne's turn, who appeared on the
      threshold, to scratch his ear. The landlord saluted the new arrival as a
      man who recognizes his true guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur," he said to him, with civility, "your apartment is ready for
      you, and the stables too, only&mdash;" He looked round him and inquired,
      "Your horses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My horses may or may not arrive. That, however, matters but little to
      you, provided you are paid for what has been engaged." The landlord bowed
      lower still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have," continued the unknown traveler, "kept for me in addition, the
      small room I asked for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Malicorne, endeavoring to hide himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your friend has occupied it during the last week," said the landlord,
      pointing to Malicorne, who was trying to make himself as small as
      possible. The traveler, drawing his cloak round him so as to cover the
      lower part of his face, cast a rapid glance at Malicorne, and said, "This
      gentleman is no friend of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord started violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not acquainted with this gentleman," continued the traveler.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" exclaimed the host, turning to Malicorne, "are you not this
      gentleman's friend, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What does it matter whether I am or not, provided you are paid?" said
      Malicorne, parodying the stranger's remark in a very majestic manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It matters so far as this," said the landlord, who began to perceive that
      one person had been taken for another, "that I beg you, monsieur, to leave
      the rooms, which had been engaged beforehand, and by some one else instead
      of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still," said Malicorne, "this gentleman cannot require at the same time a
      room on the first floor and an apartment on the second. If this gentleman
      will take the room, I will take the apartment: if he prefers the
      apartment, I will be satisfied with the room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am exceedingly distressed, monsieur," said the traveler in his soft
      voice, "but I need both the room and the apartment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least, tell me for whom?" inquired Malicorne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The apartment I require for myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; but the room?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look," said the traveler, pointing towards a sort of procession which was
      approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne looked in the direction indicated, and observed borne upon a
      litter, the arrival of the Franciscan, whose installation in his apartment
      he had, with a few details of his own, related to Montalais, and whom he
      had so uselessly endeavored to convert to humbler views. The result of the
      arrival of the stranger, and of the sick Franciscan, was Malicorne's
      expulsion, without any consideration for his feelings, from the inn, by
      the landlord and the peasants who had carried the Franciscan. The details
      have already been given of what followed this expulsion; of Manicamp's
      conversation with Montalais; how Manicamp, with greater cleverness than
      Malicorne had shown, had succeeded in obtaining news of De Guiche, of the
      subsequent conversation of Montalais with Malicorne, and, finally, of the
      billets with which the Comte de Saint-Aignan had furnished Manicamp and
      Malicorne. It remains for us to inform our readers who was the traveler in
      the cloak&mdash;the principal tenant of the double apartment, of which
      Malicorne had only occupied a portion&mdash;and the Franciscan, quite as
      mysterious a personage, whose arrival, together with that of the stranger,
      unfortunately upset the two friends' plans.

    <h2>
      Chapter LII. A Jesuit of the Eleventh Year.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the first place, in order not to weary the reader's patience, we will
      hasten to answer the first question. The traveler with the cloak held over
      his face was Aramis, who, after he had left Fouquet, and taken from a
      portmanteau, which his servant had opened, a cavalier's complete costume,
      quitted the chateau, and went to the hotel of the Beau Paon, where, by
      letters, seven or eight days previously, he had, as the landlord had
      stated, directed a room and an apartment to be retained for him.
      Immediately after Malicorne and Manicamp had been turned out, Aramis
      approached the Franciscan, and asked him whether he would prefer the
      apartment or the room. The Franciscan inquired where they were both
      situated. He was told that the room was on the first, and the apartment on
      the second floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The room, then," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis did not contradict him, but, with great submissiveness, said to the
      landlord: "The room." And bowing with respect he withdrew into the
      apartment, and the Franciscan was accordingly carried at once into the
      room. Now, is it not extraordinary that this respect should be shown by a
      prelate of the Church for a simple monk, for one, too, belonging to a
      mendicant order; to whom was given up, without a request for it even, a
      room which so many travelers were desirous of obtaining? How, too, can one
      explain the unexpected arrival of Aramis at the hotel&mdash;he who had
      entered the chateau with M. Fouquet, and could have remained at the
      chateau with M. Fouquet if he had liked? The Franciscan supported his
      removal up the staircase without uttering a complaint, although it was
      evident he suffered very much, and that every time the litter knocked
      against the wall or the railing of the staircase, he experienced a
      terrible shock throughout his frame. And finally, when he had arrived in
      the room, he said to those who carried him: "Help me to place myself in
      that armchair." The bearers of the litter placed it on the ground, and
      lifting the sick man up as gently as possible, carried him to the chair he
      had indicated, which was situated at the head of the bed. "Now," he added,
      with a marked benignity of gesture and tone, "desire the landlord to
      come."
    </p>
    <p>
      They obeyed, and five minutes afterwards the landlord appeared at the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be kind enough," said the Franciscan to him, "to send these excellent
      fellows away; they are vassals of the Vicomte de Melun. They found me when
      I had fainted on the road overcome by the heat, and without thinking of
      whether they would be paid for their trouble, they wished to carry me to
      their own home. But I know at what cost to themselves is the hospitality
      which the poor extend to a sick monk, and I preferred this hotel, where,
      moreover, I was expected."
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord looked at the Franciscan in amazement, but the latter, with
      his thumb, made the sign of the cross in a peculiar manner upon his
      breast. The host replied by making a similar sign on his left shoulder.
      "Yes, indeed," he said, "we did expect you, but we hoped that you would
      arrive in a better state of health." And as the peasants were looking at
      the innkeeper, usually so supercilious, and saw how respectful he had
      become in the presence of a poor monk, the Franciscan drew from a deep
      pocket three or four pieces of gold which he held out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friends," said he, "here is something to repay you for the care you
      have taken of me. So make yourselves perfectly easy, and do not be afraid
      of leaving me here. The order to which I belong, and for which I am
      traveling, does not require me to beg; only, as the attention you have
      shown me deserves to be rewarded, take these two louis and depart in
      peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      The peasants did not dare to take them; the landlord took the two louis
      out of the monk's hand and placed them in that of one of the peasants, all
      four of whom withdrew, opening their eyes wider than ever. The door was
      then closed; and, while the innkeeper stood respectfully near it, the
      Franciscan collected himself for a moment. He then passed across his
      sallow face a hand which seemed dried up by fever, and rubbed his nervous
      and agitated fingers across his beard. His large eyes, hollowed by
      sickness and inquietude, seemed to peruse in the vague distance a mournful
      and fixed idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What physicians have you at Fontainebleau?" he inquired, after a long
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have three, holy father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are their names?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Luiniguet first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A brother of the Carmelite order, named Brother Hubert."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A secular member, named Grisart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Grisart?" murmured the monk, "send for M. Grisart immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord moved in prompt obedience to the direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me what priests are there here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What priests?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; belonging to what orders?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are Jesuits, Augustines, and Cordeliers; but the Jesuits are the
      closest at hand. Shall I send for a confessor belonging to the order of
      Jesuits?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be imagined that, at the sign of the cross which they had
      exchanged, the landlord and the invalid monk had recognized each other as
      two affiliated members of the well-known Society of Jesus. Left to
      himself, the Franciscan drew from his pocket a bundle of papers, some of
      which he read over with the most careful attention. The violence of his
      disorder, however, overcame his courage; his eyes rolled in their sockets,
      a cold sweat poured down his face, and he nearly fainted, and lay with his
      head thrown backwards and his arms hanging down on both sides of his
      chair. For more than five minutes he remained without any movement, when
      the landlord returned, bringing with him the physician, whom he hardly
      allowed time to dress himself. The noise they made in entering the room,
      the current of air, which the opening of the door occasioned, restored the
      Franciscan to his senses. He hurriedly seized hold of the papers which
      were lying about, and with his long and bony hand concealed them under the
      cushions of the chair. The landlord went out of the room, leaving patient
      and physician together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, Monsieur Grisart," said the Franciscan to the doctor;
      "approach closer, for there is no time to lose. Try, by touch and sound,
      and consider and pronounce your sentence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The landlord," replied the doctor, "told me I had the honor of attending
      an affiliated brother."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied the Franciscan, "it is so. Tell me the truth, then; I feel
      very ill, and I think I am about to die."
    </p>
    <p>
      The physician took the monk's hand, and felt his pulse. "Oh, oh," he said,
      "a dangerous fever."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you call a dangerous fever?" inquired the Franciscan, with an
      imperious look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To an affiliated member of the first or second year," replied the
      physician, looking inquiringly at the monk, "I should say&mdash;a fever
      that may be cured."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But to me?" said the Franciscan. The physician hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at my grey hair, and my forehead, full of anxious thought," he
      continued: "look at the lines in my face, by which I reckon up the trials
      I have undergone; I am a Jesuit of the eleventh year, Monsieur Grisart."
      The physician started, for, in fact, a Jesuit of the eleventh year was one
      of those men who had been initiated in all the secrets of the order, one
      of those for whom science has no more secrets, the society no further
      barriers to present&mdash;temporal obedience, no more trammels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case," said Grisart, saluting him with respect, "I am in the
      presence of a master?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; act, therefore, accordingly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you wish to know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My real state."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the physician, "it is a brain fever, which has reached its
      highest degree of intensity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no hope, then?" inquired the Franciscan, in a quick tone of
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not say that," replied the doctor; "yet, considering the disordered
      state of the brain, the hurried respiration, the rapidity of the pulse,
      and the burning nature of the fever which is devouring you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And which has thrice prostrated me since this morning," said the monk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All things considered, I shall call it a terrible attack. But why did you
      not stop on your road?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was expected here, and I was obliged to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even at the risk of your life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, at the risk of dying on the way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. Considering all the symptoms of your case, I must tell you
      that your condition is almost desperate."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Franciscan smiled in a strange manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What you have just told me is, perhaps, sufficient for what is due to an
      affiliated member, even of the eleventh year; but for what is due to me,
      Monsieur Grisart, it is too little, and I have a right to demand more.
      Come, then, let us be more candid still, and as frank as if you were
      making your own confession to Heaven. Besides, I have already sent for a
      confessor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I have hopes, however," murmured the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Answer me," said the sick man, displaying with a dignified gesture a
      golden ring, the stone of which had until that moment been turned inside,
      and which bore engraved thereon the distinguishing mark of the Society of
      Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grisart uttered loud exclamation. "The general!" he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silence," said the Franciscan., "you can now understand that the whole
      truth is all important."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur, monseigneur," murmured Grisart, "send for the confessor, for
      in two hours, at the next seizure, you will be attacked by delirium, and
      will pass away in its course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said the patient, for a moment contracting his eyebrows, "I
      have still two hours to live then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; particularly if you take the potion I will send you presently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that will give me two hours of life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two hours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would take it, were it poison, for those two hours are necessary not
      only for myself, but for the glory of the order."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a loss, what a catastrophe for us all!" murmured the physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the loss of one man&mdash;nothing more," replied the Franciscan,
      "for Heaven will enable the poor monk, who is about to leave you, to find
      a worthy successor. Adieu, Monsieur Grisart; already even, through the
      goodness of Heaven, I have met with you. A physician who had not been one
      of our holy order, would have left me in ignorance of my condition; and,
      confident that existence would be prolonged a few days further, I should
      not have taken the necessary precautions. You are a learned man, Monsieur
      Grisart, and that confers an honor upon us all; it would have been
      repugnant to my feelings to have found one of our order of little standing
      in his profession. Adieu, Monsieur Grisart; send me the cordial
      immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me your blessing, at least, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In my mind, I do; go, go; in my mind, I do so, I tell you&mdash;<i>animo</i>,
      Maitre Grisart, <i>viribus impossibile</i>." And he again fell back on the
      armchair, in an almost senseless state. M. Grisart hesitated, whether he
      should give him immediate assistance, or should run to prepare the cordial
      he had promised. He decided in favor of the cordial, for he darted out of
      the room and disappeared down the staircase. <a href="#linknote-6"

    <h2>
      Chapter LIII. The State Secret.
    </h2>
    <p>
      A few moments after the doctor's departure, the confessor arrived. He had
      hardly crossed the threshold of the door when the Franciscan fixed a
      penetrating look upon him, and, shaking his head, murmured&mdash;"A weak
      mind, I see; may Heaven forgive me if I die without the help of this
      living piece of human infirmity." The confessor, on his side, regarded the
      dying man with astonishment, almost with terror. He had never beheld eyes
      so burningly bright at the very moment they were about to close, nor looks
      so terrible at the moment they were about to be quenched in death. The
      Franciscan made a rapid and imperious movement of his hand. "Sit down,
      there, my father," he said, "and listen to me." The Jesuit confessor, a
      good priest, a recently initiated member of the order, who had merely seen
      the beginning of its mysteries, yielded to the superiority assumed by the
      penitent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are several persons staying in this hotel," continued the
      Franciscan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," inquired the Jesuit, "I thought I had been summoned to listen to a
      confession. Is your remark, then, a confession?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In order to know whether I am to keep your words secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My remarks are part of my confession; I confide them to you in your
      character of a confessor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said the priest, seating himself on the chair which the
      Franciscan had, with great difficulty, just left, to lie down on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Franciscan continued,&mdash;"I repeat, there are several persons
      staying in this inn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I have heard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They ought to be eight in number."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jesuit made a sign that he understood him. "The first to whom I wish
      to speak," said the dying man, "is a German from Vienna, whose name is
      Baron de Wostpur. Be kind enough to go to him, and tell him the person he
      expected has arrived." The confessor, astounded, looked at his penitent;
      the confession seemed a singular one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Obey," said the Franciscan, in a tone of command impossible to resist.
      The good Jesuit, completely subdued, rose and left the room. As soon as he
      had gone, the Franciscan again took up the papers which a crisis of the
      fever had already, once before, obliged him to put aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Baron de Wostpur? Good!" he said; "ambitious, a fool, and straitened
      in means."
    </p>
    <p>
      He folded up the papers, which he thrust under his pillow. Rapid footsteps
      were heard at the end of the corridor. The confessor returned, followed by
      the Baron de Wostpur, who walked along with his head raised, as if he were
      discussing with himself the possibility of touching the ceiling with the
      feather in his hat. Therefore, at the appearance of the Franciscan, at his
      melancholy look, and seeing the plainness of the room, he stopped, and
      inquired,&mdash;"Who has summoned me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I," said the Franciscan, who turned towards the confessor, saying, "My
      good father, leave us for a moment together; when this gentleman leaves,
      you will return here." The Jesuit left the room, and, doubtless, availed
      himself of this momentary exile from the presence of the dying man to ask
      the host for some explanation about this strange penitent, who treated his
      confessor no better than he would a man servant. The baron approached the
      bed, and wished to speak, but the hand of the Franciscan imposed silence
      upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every moment is precious," said the latter, hurriedly. "You have come
      here for the competition, have you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hope to be elected general of the order?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know on what conditions only you can possibly attain this high
      position, which makes one man the master of monarchs, the equal of popes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you," inquired the baron, "to subject me to these
      interrogations?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am he whom you expected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The elector-general?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am the elected."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Franciscan did not give him time to reply; he extended his shrunken
      hand, on which glittered the ring of the general of the order. The baron
      drew back in surprise; and then, immediately afterwards, bowing with the
      profoundest respect, he exclaimed,&mdash;"Is it possible that you are
      here, monseigneur; you, in this wretched room; you, upon this miserable
      bed; you, in search of and selecting the future general, that is, your own
      successor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not distress yourself about that, monsieur, but fulfil immediately the
      principal condition, of furnishing the order with a secret of importance,
      of such importance that one of the greatest courts of Europe will, by your
      instrumentality, forever be subjected to the order. Well! do you possess
      the secret which you promised, in your request, addressed to the grand
      council?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us proceed, however, in due order," said the monk. "You are the Baron
      de Wostpur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this letter is from you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      The general of the Jesuits drew a paper from his bundle, and presented it
      to the baron, who glanced at it, and made a sign in the affirmative,
      saying, "Yes, monseigneur, this letter is mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you show me the reply which the secretary of the grand council
      returned to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here it is," said the baron, holding towards the Franciscan a letter
      bearing simply the address, "To his excellency the Baron de Wostpur," and
      containing only this phrase, "From the 15th to the 22nd May,
      Fontainebleau, the hotel of the Beau Paon.&mdash;A. M. D. G." <a
      href="#linknote-7" name="linknoteref-7" id="linknoteref-7"><small>7</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right," said the Franciscan, "and now speak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have a body of troops, composed of 50,000 men; all the officers are
      gained over. I am encamped on the Danube. In four days I can overthrow the
      emperor, who is, as you are aware, opposed to the progress of our order,
      and can replace him by whichever of the princes of his family the order
      may determine upon." The Franciscan listened, unmoved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that all?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A revolution throughout Europe is included in my plan," said the baron.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, Monsieur de Wostpur, you will receive a reply; return to your
      room, and leave Fontainebleau within a quarter of an hour." The baron
      withdrew backwards, as obsequiously as if he were taking leave of the
      emperor he was ready to betray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no secret there," murmured the Franciscan, "it is a plot.
      Besides," he added, after a moment's reflection, "the future of Europe is
      no longer in the hands of the House of Austria."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a pencil he held in his hand, he struck the Baron de Wostpur's
      name from the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now for the cardinal," he said; "we ought to get something more serious
      from the side of Spain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raising his head, he perceived the confessor, who was awaiting his orders
      as respectfully as a school-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, ah!" he said, noticing his submissive air, "you have been talking
      with the landlord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, monseigneur; and to the physician."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Grisart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is here, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is waiting with the potion he promised."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; if I require him, I will call; you now understand the great
      importance of my confession, do you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then go and fetch me the Spanish Cardinal Herrebia. Make haste. Only, as
      you now understand the matter in hand, you will remain near me, for I
      begin to feel faint."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I summon the physician?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet, not yet... the Spanish cardinal, no one else. Fly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes afterwards, the cardinal, pale and disturbed, entered the
      little room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am informed, monseigneur,&mdash;" stammered the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the point," said the Franciscan, in a faint voice, showing the
      cardinal a letter which he had written to the grand council. "Is that your
      handwriting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your summons?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal hesitated to answer. His purple revolted against the mean
      garb of the poor Franciscan, who stretched out his hand and displayed the
      ring, which produced its effect, greater in proportion to the greatness of
      the person over whom the Franciscan exercised his influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quick, the secret, the secret!" said the dying man, leaning upon his
      confessor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Coram isto?</i>" inquired the Spanish cardinal. <a href="#linknote-8"
      name="linknoteref-8" id="linknoteref-8"><small>8</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak in Spanish," said the Franciscan, showing the liveliest attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are aware, monseigneur," said the cardinal, continuing the
      conversation in Castilian, "that the condition of the marriage of the
      Infanta with the king of France was the absolute renunciation of the
      rights of the said Infanta, as well as of King Louis XIV., to all claim to
      the crown of Spain." The Franciscan made a sign in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The consequence is," continued the cardinal, "that the peace and alliance
      between the two kingdoms depend upon the observance of that clause of the
      contract." A similar sign from the Franciscan. "Not only France and
      Spain," continued the cardinal, "but the whole of Europe even, would be
      violently rent asunder by the faithlessness of either party." Another
      movement of the dying man's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It further results," continued the speaker, "that the man who might be
      able to foresee events, and to render certain that which is no more than a
      vague idea floating in the mind of man, that is to say, the idea of a
      future good or evil, would preserve the world from a great catastrophe;
      and the event, which has no fixed certainty even in the brain of him who
      originated it, could be turned to the advantage of our order."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Pronto</i>, <i>pronto!</i>" murmured the Franciscan, in Spanish, who
      suddenly became paler, and leaned upon the priest. The cardinal approached
      the ear of the dying man, and said, "Well, monseigneur, I know that the
      king of France has determined that, at the very first pretext, a death for
      instance, either that of the king of Spain, or that of a brother of the
      Infanta, France will, arms in hand, claim the inheritance, and I have in
      my possession, already prepared, the plan of policy agreed upon by Louis
      XIV. for this occasion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this plan?" said the Franciscan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here it is," returned the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In whose handwriting is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you anything further to say to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I have said a good deal, my lord," replied the cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you have rendered the order a great service. But how did you procure
      the details, by the aid of which you have constructed your plan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have the under-servants of the king of France in my pay, and I obtain
      from them all the waste papers, which have been saved from being burnt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very ingenious," murmured the Franciscan, endeavoring to smile; "you will
      leave this hotel, cardinal, in a quarter of an hour, and a reply shall be
      sent you." The cardinal withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call Grisart, and desire the Venetian Marini to come," said the sick man.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the confessor obeyed, the Franciscan, instead of striking out the
      cardinal's name, as he had done the baron's, made a cross at the side of
      it. Then, exhausted by the effort, he fell back on his bed, murmuring the
      name of Dr. Grisart. When he returned to his senses, he had drunk about
      half of the potion, of which the remainder was left in the glass, and he
      found himself supported by the physician, while the Venetian and the
      confessor were standing close to the door. The Venetian submitted to the
      same formalities as his two predecessors, hesitated as they had done at
      the sight of the two strangers, but his confidence restored by the order
      of the general, he revealed that the pope, terrified at the power of the
      order, was weaving a plot for the general expulsion of the Jesuits, and
      was tampering with the different courts of Europe in order to obtain their
      assistance. He described the pontiff's auxiliaries, his means of action,
      and indicated the particular locality in the Archipelago where, by a
      sudden surprise, two cardinals, adepts of the eleventh year, and,
      consequently, high in authority, were to be transported, together with
      thirty-two of the principal affiliated members of Rome. The Franciscan
      thanked the Signor Marini. It was by no means a slight service he had
      rendered the society by denouncing this pontifical project. The Venetian
      thereupon received directions to set off in a quarter of an hour, and left
      as radiant as if he already possessed the ring, the sign of the supreme
      authority of the society. As, however, he was departing, the Franciscan
      murmured to himself: "All these men are either spies, or a sort of police,
      not one of them a general; they have all discovered a plot, but not one of
      them a secret. It is not by means of ruin, or war, or force, that the
      Society of Jesus is to be governed, but by that mysterious influence moral
      superiority alone confers. No, the man is not yet found, and to complete
      the misfortune, Heaven strikes me down, and I am dying. Oh! must the
      society indeed fall with me for want of a column to support it? Must
      death, which is waiting for me, swallow up with me the future of the
      order; that future which ten years more of my own life would have rendered
      eternal? for that future, with the reign of the new king, is opening
      radiant and full of splendor." These words, which had been half-reflected,
      half-pronounced aloud, were listened to by the Jesuit confessor with a
      terror similar to that with which one listens to the wanderings of a
      person attacked by fever, whilst Grisart, with a mind of higher order,
      devoured them as the revelations of an unknown world, in which his looks
      were plunged without ability to comprehend. Suddenly the Franciscan
      recovered himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us finish this," he said; "death is approaching. Oh! just now I was
      dying resignedly, for I hoped... while now I sink in despair, unless those
      who remain... Grisart, Grisart, give me to live a single hour longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Grisart approached the dying monk, and made him swallow a few drops, not
      of the potion which was still left in the glass, but of the contents of a
      small bottle he had upon his person.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call the Scotchman!" exclaimed the Franciscan; "call the Bremen merchant.
      Call, call quickly. I am dying. I am suffocated."
    </p>
    <p>
      The confessor darted forward to seek assistance, as if there had been any
      human strength which could hold back the hand of death, which was weighing
      down the sick man; but, at the threshold of the door, he found Aramis,
      who, with his finger on his lips, like the statue of Harpocrates, the god
      of silence, by a look motioned him back to the end of the apartment. The
      physician and the confessor, after having consulted each other by looks,
      made a movement as if to push Aramis aside, who, however, with two signs
      of the cross, each made in a different manner, transfixed them both in
      their places.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A chief!" they both murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis slowly advanced into the room where the dying man was struggling
      against the first attack of the agony which had seized him. As for the
      Franciscan, whether owing to the effect of the elixir, or whether the
      appearance of Aramis had restored his strength, he made a movement, and
      his eyes glaring, his mouth half open, and his hair damp with sweat, sat
      up upon the bed. Aramis felt that the air of the room was stifling; the
      windows were closed; the fire was burning upon the hearth; a pair of
      candles of yellow wax were guttering down in the copper candlesticks, and
      still further increased, by their thick smoke, the temperature of the
      room. Aramis opened the window, and fixing upon the dying man a look full
      of intelligence and respect, said to him: "Monseigneur, pray forgive my
      coming in this manner, before you summoned me, but your state alarms me,
      and I thought you might possibly die before you had seen me, for I am but
      the sixth upon your list."
    </p>
    <p>
      The dying man started and looked at the list.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are, therefore, he who was formerly called Aramis, and since, the
      Chevalier d'Herblay? You are the bishop of Vannes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you, I have seen you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the last jubilee, we were with the Holy Father together."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, I remember; and you place yourself on the list of candidates?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur, I have heard it said that the order required to become
      possessed of a great state secret, and knowing that from modesty you had
      in anticipation resigned your functions in favor of the person who should
      be the depositary of such a secret, I wrote to say that I was ready to
      compete, possessing alone a secret I believe to be important."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak," said the Franciscan; "I am ready to listen to you, and to judge
      the importance of the secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A secret of the value of that which I have the honor to confide to you
      cannot be communicated by word of mouth. Any idea which, when once
      expressed, has thereby lost its safeguard, and has become vulgarized by
      any manifestation or communication of it whatever, no longer is the
      property of him who gave it birth. My words may be overheard by some
      listener, or perhaps by an enemy; one ought not, therefore, to speak at
      random, for, in such a case, the secret would cease to be one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you propose, then, to convey your secret?" inquired the dying
      monk.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one hand Aramis signed to the physician and the confessor to
      withdraw, and with the other he handed to the Franciscan a paper enclosed
      in a double envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is not writing more dangerous still than language?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my lord," said Aramis, "for you will find within this envelope
      characters which you and I alone can understand." The Franciscan looked at
      Aramis with an astonishment which momentarily increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a cipher," continued the latter, "which you used in 1655, and which
      your secretary, Juan Jujan, who is dead, could alone decipher, if he were
      restored to life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You knew this cipher, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was I who taught it him," said Aramis, bowing with a gracefulness full
      of respect, and advancing towards the door as if to leave the room: but a
      gesture of the Franciscan accompanied by a cry for him to remain,
      restrained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Ecce homo!</i>" he exclaimed; then reading the paper a second time, he
      called out, "Approach, approach quickly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis returned to the side of the Franciscan, with the same calm
      countenance and the same respectful manner, unchanged. The Franciscan,
      extending his arm, burnt by the flame of the candle the paper which Aramis
      had handed him. Then, taking hold of Aramis's hand, he drew him towards
      him, and inquired: "In what manner and by whose means could you possibly
      become acquainted with such a secret?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Through Madame de Chevreuse, the intimate friend and <i>confidante</i> of
      the queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Madame de Chevreuse&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did any others know it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man and a woman only, and they of the lower classes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Persons who had brought him up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has become of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead also. This secret burns like vitriol."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you survive?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one is aware that I know it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for what length of time have you possessed this secret?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the last fifteen years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you have kept it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wished to live."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you give it to the order without ambition, without acknowledgement?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give it to the order with ambition and with a hope of return," said
      Aramis; "for if you live, my lord, you will make of me, now you know me,
      what I can and ought to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And as I am dying," exclaimed the Franciscan, "I constitute you my
      successor... Thus." And drawing off the ring, he passed it on Aramis's
      finger. Then, turning towards the two spectators of this scene, he said:
      "Be ye witnesses of this, and testify, if need be, that, sick in body, but
      sound in mind, I have freely and voluntarily bestowed this ring, the token
      of supreme authority, upon Monseigneur d'Herblay, bishop of Vannes, whom I
      nominate my successor, and before whom I, an humble sinner, about to
      appear before Heaven, prostrate myself, as an example for all to follow."
      And the Franciscan bowed lowly and submissively, whilst the physician and
      the Jesuit fell on their knees. Aramis, even while he became paler than
      the dying man himself, bent his looks successively upon all the actors of
      this scene. Profoundly gratified ambition flowed with life-blood towards
      his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must lose no time," said the Franciscan; "what I had still to do on
      earth was urgent. I shall never succeed in carrying it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do it," said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is well," said the Franciscan, and then turning towards the Jesuit and
      the doctor, he added, "Leave us alone," a direction they instantly obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With this sign," he said, "you are the man needed to shake the world from

    <p>
      "Close the door," continued the Franciscan after a pause. Aramis shut and
      bolted the door, and returned to the side of the Franciscan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The pope is conspiring against the order," said the monk; "the pope must
      die."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He shall die," said Aramis, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seven hundred thousand livres are owing to a Bremen merchant of the name
      of Bonstett, who came here to get the guarantee of my signature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He shall be paid," said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Six knights of Malta, whose names are written here, have discovered, by
      the indiscretion of one of the affiliated of the eleventh year, the three
      mysteries; it must be ascertained what else these men have done with the
      secret, to get it back again and bury it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three dangerous affiliated members must be sent away into Tibet, there to
      perish; they stand condemned. Here are their names."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will see that the sentence be carried out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lastly, there is a lady at Anvers, grand-niece of Ravaillac; she holds
      certain papers in her hands that compromise the order. There has been
      payable to the family during the last fifty-one years a pension of fifty
      thousand livres. The pension is a heavy one, and the order is not wealthy.
      Redeem the papers, for a sum of money paid down, or, in case of refusal,
      stop the pension&mdash;but run no risk."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will quickly decide what is best to be done," said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A vessel chartered from Lima entered the port of Lisbon last week;
      ostensibly it is laden with chocolate, in reality with gold. Every ingot
      is concealed by a coating of chocolate. The vessel belongs to the order;
      it is worth seventeen millions of livres; you will see that it is claimed;
      here are the bills of landing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To what port shall I direct it to be taken?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Bayonne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Before three weeks are over it shall be there, wind and weather
      permitting. Is that all?" The Franciscan made a sign in the affirmative,
      for he could no longer speak; the blood rushed to his throat and his head,
      and gushed from his mouth, his nostrils, and his eyes. The dying man had
      barely time to press Aramis's hand, when he fell in convulsions from his
      bed upon the floor. Aramis placed his hand upon the Franciscan's heart,
      but it had ceased to beat. As he stooped down, Aramis observed that a
      fragment of the paper he had given the Franciscan had escaped being burnt.
      He picked it up, and burnt it to the last atom. Then, summoning the
      confessor and the physician, he said to the former: "Your penitent is in
      heaven; he needs nothing more than prayers and the burial bestowed upon
      the pious dead. Go and prepare what is necessary for a simple interment,
      such as a poor monk only would require. Go."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jesuit left the room. Then, turning towards the physician, and
      observing his pale and anxious face, he said, in a low tone of voice:
      "Monsieur Grisart, empty and clean this glass; <i>there is too much left
      in it of what the grand council desired you to put in</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Grisart, amazed, overcome, completely astounded, almost fell backwards in
      his extreme terror. Aramis shrugged his shoulders in sign of pity, took
      the glass, and poured out the contents among the ashes of the hearth. He
      then left the room, carrying the papers of the dead man with him.

    <p>
      The next day, or rather the same day (for the events we have just
      described were concluded only at three o'clock in the morning), before
      breakfast was served, and as the king was preparing to go to mass with the
      two queens; as Monsieur, with the Chevalier de Lorraine, and a few other
      intimate companions, was mounting his horse to set off for the river, to
      take one of those celebrated baths with which the ladies of the court were
      so infatuated, as, in fact, no one remained in the chateau, with the
      exception of Madame who, under the pretext of indisposition, would not
      leave her room; Montalais was seen, or rather not was not seen, to glide
      stealthily out of the room appropriated to the maids of honor, leading La
      Valliere after her, who tried to conceal herself as much as possible, and
      both of them, hurrying secretly through the gardens, succeeded, looking
      round them at every step they took, in reaching the thicket. The weather
      was cloudy, a warm breeze bowed the flowers and the shrubs, the burning
      dust, swept along in clouds by the wind, was whirled in eddies towards the
      trees. Montalais, who, during their progress, had discharged the functions
      of a clever scout, advanced a few steps further, and turning round again,
      to be quite sure that no one was either listening or approaching, said to
      her companion, "Thank goodness, we are quite alone! Since yesterday every
      one spies on us here, and a circle seems to be drawn round us, as if we
      were plague-stricken." La Valliere bent down her head and sighed. "It is
      positively unheard of," continued Montalais; "from M. Malicorne to M. de
      Saint-Aignan, every one wishes to get hold of our secret. Come, Louise,
      let us take counsel, you and I, together, in order that I may know what to
      do."
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere lifted towards her companion her beautiful eyes, pure and deep
      as the azure of a spring sky, "And I," she said, "will ask you why we have
      been summoned to Madame's own room? Why have we slept close to her
      apartment, instead of sleeping as usual in our own? Why did you return so
      late, and whence are these measures of strict supervision which have been
      adopted since this morning, with respect to us both?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Louise, you answer my question by another, or rather, by ten
      others, which is not answering me at all. I will tell you all you want to
      know later, and as it is of secondary importance, you can wait. What I ask
      you&mdash;for everything will depend upon that&mdash;is, whether there is
      or is not any secret?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know if there is any secret," said La Valliere; "but I do know,
      for my part at least, that there has been great imprudence committed.
      Since the foolish remark I made, and my still more silly fainting
      yesterday, every one here is making remarks about us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak for yourself," said Montalais, laughing, "speak for yourself and
      for Tonnay-Charente; for both of you made your declarations of love to the
      skies, which unfortunately were intercepted."
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere hung down her head. "Really you overwhelm me," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you torture me with your jests."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen to me, Louise. These are no jests, for nothing is more serious; on
      the contrary, I did not drag you out of the chateau; I did not miss
      attending mass; I did not pretend to have a cold, as Madame did, which she
      has no more than I have; and, lastly, I did not display ten times more
      diplomacy than M. Colbert inherited from M. de Mazarin, and makes use of
      with respect to M. Fouquet, in order to find means of confiding my
      perplexities to you, for the sole end and purpose that, when at last we
      were alone, with no one to listen to us, you should deal hypocritically
      with me. No, no; believe me, that when I ask you a question, it is not
      from curiosity alone, but really because the position is a critical one.
      What you said yesterday is now known,&mdash;it is a text on which every
      one is discoursing. Every one embellishes it to the utmost, and according
      to his own fancy; you had the honor last night, and you have it still
      to-day, of occupying the whole court, my dear Louise; and the number of
      tender and witty remarks which have been ascribed to you, would make
      Mademoiselle de Scudery and her brother burst from very spite, if they
      were faithfully reported."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, dearest Montalais," said the poor girl, "you know better than any
      one exactly what I said, since you were present when I said it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know. But that is not the question. I have not forgotten a single
      syllable you uttered, but did you think what you were saying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Louise became confused. "What," she exclaimed, "more questions still! Oh,
      heavens! when I would give the world to forget what I did say, how does it
      happen that every one does all he possibly can to remind me of it? Oh,
      this is indeed terrible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To have a friend who ought to spare me, who might advise me and help me
      to save myself, and yet who is undoing me&mdash;is killing me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there, that will do," said Montalais; "after having said too
      little, you now say too much. No one thinks of killing you, nor even of
      robbing you, even of your secret; I wish to have it voluntarily, and in no
      other way; for the question does not concern your own affairs only, but
      ours also; and Tonnay-Charente would tell you as I do, if she were here.
      For, the fact is, that last evening she wished to have some private
      conversation in our room, and I was going there after the Manicamp and
      Malicorne colloquies terminated, when I learned, on my return, rather
      late, it is true, that Madame had sequestered her maids of honor, and that
      we were to sleep in her apartments, instead of our own. Moreover, Madame
      has shut up her maids of honor in order that they should not have the time
      to concert any measures together, and this morning she was closeted with
      Tonnay-Charente with the same object. Tell me, then, to what extent
      Athenais and I can rely upon you, as we will tell you in what way you can
      rely upon us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not clearly understand the question you have put," said Louise, much
      agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum! and yet, on the contrary, you seem to understand me very well.
      However, I will put my questions in a more precise manner, in order that
      you may not be able, in the slightest degree, to evade them. Listen to me:
      <i>Do you love M. de Bragelonne?</i> That is plain enough, is it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this question, which fell like the first bombshell of a besieging army
      into a doomed town, Louise started. "You ask me," she exclaimed, "if I
      love Raoul, the friend of my childhood,&mdash;my brother almost?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, no! Again you evade me, or rather, you wish to escape me. I do
      not ask if you love Raoul, your childhood's friend,&mdash;your brother;
      but I ask if you love the Vicomte de Bragelonne, your affianced husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens! dear Montalais," said Louise, "how severe your tone is!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You deserve no indulgence,&mdash;I am neither more nor less severe than
      usual. I put a question to you, so answer it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You certainly do not," said Louise, in a choking voice, "speak to me like
      a friend; but I will answer you as a true friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; my heart is full of scruples and silly feelings of pride, with
      respect to everything that a woman ought to keep secret, and in this
      respect no one has ever read into the bottom of my soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I know very well. If I had read it, I should not interrogate you as
      I have done; I should simply say,&mdash;'My good Louise, you have the
      happiness of an acquaintance with M. de Bragelonne, who is an excellent
      young man, and an advantageous match for a girl without fortune. M. de la
      Fere will leave something like fifteen thousand livres a year to his son.
      At a future day, then, you, as this son's wife, will have fifteen thousand
      livres a year; which is not bad. Turn, then, neither to the right hand nor
      to the left, but go frankly to M. de Bragelonne; that is to say, to the
      altar to which he will lead you. Afterwards, why&mdash; afterwards,
      according to his disposition, you will be emancipated or enslaved; in
      other words, you will have a right to commit any piece of folly people
      commit who have either too much liberty or too little.' That is, my dear
      Louise, what I should have told you at first, if I had been able to read
      your heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I should have thanked you," stammered out Louise, "although the
      advice does not appear to me to be altogether sound."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait, wait. But immediately after having given you that advice, I should
      have added,&mdash;'Louise, it is very dangerous to pass whole days with
      your head drooping, your hands unoccupied, your eyes restless and full of
      thought; it is dangerous to prefer the least frequented paths, and no
      longer be amused with such diversions as gladden young girls' hearts; it
      is dangerous, Louise, to scrawl with the point of your foot, as you do,
      upon the gravel, certain letters it is useless for you to efface, but
      which appear again under your heel, particularly when those letters rather
      resemble the letter L than the letter B; and, lastly, it is dangerous to
      allow the mind to dwell on a thousand wild fancies, the fruits of solitude
      and heartache; these fancies, while they sink into a young girl's mind,
      make her cheeks sink in also, so that it is not unusual, on such
      occasions, to find the most delightful persons in the world become the
      most disagreeable, and the wittiest to become the dullest.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you, dearest Aure," replied La Valliere, gently; "it is like you
      to speak to me in this manner, and I thank you for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was only for the benefit of wild dreamers, such as I have just
      described, that I spoke; do not take any of my words, then, to yourself,
      except such as you think you deserve. Stay, I hardly know what story
      recurs to my memory of some silly or melancholy girl, who was gradually
      pining away because she fancied that the prince, or the king, or the
      emperor, whoever it was&mdash;and it does not matter much which&mdash;had
      fallen in love with her; while on the contrary, the prince, or the king,
      or the emperor, whichever you please, was plainly in love with some one
      else, and&mdash;a singular circumstance, one, indeed, which she could not
      perceive, although every one around and about her perceived it clearly
      enough&mdash; made use of her as a screen for his own love affair. You
      laugh as I do, at this poor silly girl, do you not, Louise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?&mdash;oh! of course," stammered Louise, pale as death.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are right, too, for the thing is amusing enough. The story,
      whether true or false, amused me, and so I remembered it and told it to
      you. Just imagine then, my good Louise, the mischief that such a
      melancholy would create in anybody's brain,&mdash;a melancholy, I mean, of
      that kind. For my own part, I resolved to tell you the story; for if such
      a thing were to happen to either of <i>us</i>, it would be most essential
      to be assured of its truth; to-day it is a snare, to-morrow it would
      become a jest and mockery, the next day it would mean death itself." La
      Valliere started again, and became, if possible, still paler.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whenever a king takes notice of us," continued Montalais, "he lets us see
      it easily enough, and, if we happen to be the object he covets, he knows
      very well how to gain his object. You see, then, Louise, that, in such
      circumstances, between young girls exposed to such a danger as the one in
      question, the most perfect confidence should exist, in order that those
      hearts which are not disposed towards melancholy may watch over those
      likely to become so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silence, silence!" said La Valliere; "some one approaches."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some one is approaching fast, in fact," said Montalais; "but who can it
      possibly be? Everybody is away, either at mass with the king, or bathing
      with Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the walk the young girls perceived almost immediately,
      beneath the arching trees, the graceful carriage and noble stature of a
      young man, who, with his sword under his arm and a cloak thrown across his
      shoulders, booted and spurred besides, saluted them from the distance with
      a gentle smile. "Raoul!" exclaimed Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Bragelonne!" murmured Louise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A very proper judge to decide upon our difference of opinion," said
      Montalais.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Montalais, Montalais, for pity's sake," exclaimed La Valliere, "after
      having been so cruel, show me a little mercy." These words, uttered with
      all the fervor of a prayer, effaced all trace of irony, if not from
      Montalais's heart, at least from her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you are as handsome as Amadis, Monsieur de Bragelonne," she cried to
      Raoul, "and armed and booted like him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thousand compliments, young ladies," replied Raoul, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But why, I ask, are you booted in this manner?" repeated Montalais,
      whilst La Valliere, although she looked at Raoul with a surprise equal to
      that of her companion, nevertheless uttered not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" inquired Raoul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" ventured Louise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I am about to set off," said Bragelonne, looking at Louise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl seemed as though smitten by some superstitious feeling of
      terror, and tottered. "You are going away, Raoul!" she cried; "and where
      are you going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dearest Louise," he replied, with that quiet, composed manner which was
      natural to him, "I am going to England."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you going to do in England?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king has sent me there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king!" exclaimed Louise and Aure together, involuntarily exchanging
      glances, the conversation which had just been interrupted recurring to
      them both. Raoul intercepted the glance, but could not understand its
      meaning, and, naturally enough, attributed it to the interest both the
      young girls took in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His majesty," he said, "has been good enough to remember that the Comte
      de la Fere is high in favor with King Charles II. This morning, as he was
      on his way to attend mass, the king, seeing me as he passed, signed to me
      to approach, which I accordingly did. 'Monsieur de Bragelonne,' he said to
      me, 'you will call upon M. Fouquet, who has received from me letters for
      the king of Great Britain; you will be the bearer of them.' I bowed. 'Ah!'
      his majesty added, 'before you leave, you will be good enough to take any
      commissions which Madame may have for the king her brother.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious heaven!" murmured Louise, much agitated, and yet full of thought
      at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So quickly! You are desired to set off in such haste!" said Montalais,
      almost paralyzed by this unforeseen event.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Properly to obey those whom we respect," said Raoul, "it is necessary to
      obey quickly. Within ten minutes after I had received the order, I was
      ready. Madame, already informed, is writing the letter which she is good
      enough to do me the honor of intrusting to me. In the meantime, learning
      from Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente that it was likely you would be in
      this direction, I came here, and am happy to find you both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And both of us very sad, as you see," said Montalais, going to Louise's
      assistance, whose countenance was visibly altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suffering?" responded Raoul, pressing Louise's hand with a tender
      curiosity. "Your hand is like ice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This coldness does not reach your heart, Louise, does it?" inquired the
      young man, with a tender smile. Louise raised her head hastily, as if the
      question had been inspired by some suspicion, and had aroused a feeling of
      remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! you know," she said, with an effort, "that my heart will never be
      cold towards a friend like yourself, Monsieur de Bragelonne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Louise. I know both your heart and your mind; it is not by the
      touch of the hand that one can judge of an affection like yours. You know,
      Louise, how devotedly I love you, with what perfect and unreserved
      confidence I reserve my life for you; will you not forgive me, then, for
      speaking to you with something like the frankness of a child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Speak, Monsieur Raoul," said Louise, trembling painfully, "I am
      listening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot part from you, carrying away with me a thought that tortures me;
      absurd I know it to be, and yet one which rends my very heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you going away, then, for any length of time?" inquired La Valliere,
      with faltering utterance, while Montalais turned her head aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; probably I shall not be absent more than a fortnight." La Valliere
      pressed her hand upon her heart, which felt as though it were breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is strange," pursued Raoul, looking at the young girl with a
      melancholy expression; "I have often left you when setting off on
      adventures fraught with danger. Then I started joyously enough&mdash;my
      heart free, my mind intoxicated by thoughts of happiness in store for me,
      hopes of which the future was full; and yet I was about to face the
      Spanish cannon, or the halberds of the Walloons. To-day, without the
      existence of any danger or uneasiness, and by the sunniest path in the
      world, I am going in search of a glorious recompense, which this mark of
      the king's favor seems to indicate, for I am, perhaps, going to win <i>you</i>,
      Louise. What other favor, more precious than yourself, could the king
      confer upon me? Yet, Louise, in very truth I know not how or why, but this
      happiness and this future seem to vanish before my very eyes like mist&mdash;like
      an idle dream; and I feel here, here at the very bottom of my heart, a
      deep-seated grief, a dejection I cannot overcome&mdash; something heavy,
      passionless, death-like,&mdash;resembling a corpse. Oh! Louise, too well
      do I know why; it is because I have never loved you so truly as now. God
      help me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this last exclamation, which issued as it were from a broken heart,
      Louise burst into tears, and threw herself into Montalais's arms. The
      latter, although she was not easily moved, felt the tears rush to her
      eyes. Raoul noted only the tears Louise shed; his look, however, did not
      penetrate&mdash;nay, sought not to penetrate&mdash;beyond those tears. He
      bent his knee before her, and tenderly kissed her hand; and it was evident
      that in that kiss he poured out his whole heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rise, rise," said Montalais to him, ready to cry, "for Athenais is
      coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul rose, brushed his knee with the back of his hand, smiled again upon
      Louise, whose eyes were fixed on the ground, and, having pressed
      Montalais's hand gratefully, he turned round to salute Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente, the sound of whose silken robe was already heard upon the
      gravel walk. "Has Madame finished her letter?" he inquired, when the young
      girl came within reach of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, the letter is finished, sealed, and her royal highness is ready to
      receive you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul, at this remark, hardly gave himself time to salute Athenais, cast
      one look at Louise, bowed to Montalais, and withdrew in the direction of
      the chateau. As he withdrew he again turned round, but at last, at the end
      of the grand walk, it was useless to do so again, as he could no longer
      see them. The three young girls, on their side, had, with widely different
      feelings, watched him disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At last," said Athenais, the first to interrupt the silence, "at last we
      are alone, free to talk of yesterday's great affair, and to come to an
      understanding upon the conduct it is advisable for us to pursue. Besides,
      if you will listen to me," she continued, looking round on all sides, "I
      will explain to you, as briefly as possible, in the first place, our own
      duty, such as I imagine it to be, and, if you do not understand a hint,
      what is Madame's desire on the subject." And Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente pronounced these words in such a tone as to leave no
      doubt, in her companion's minds, upon the official character with which
      she was invested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame's desire!" exclaimed Montalais and La Valliere together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her <i>ultimatum</i>," replied Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente,
      diplomatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," murmured La Valliere, "does Madame know, then&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame knows more about the matter than we said, even," said Athenais, in
      a formal, precise manner. "Therefore let us come to a proper
      understanding."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed," said Montalais, "and I am listening in breathless
      attention."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gracious heavens!" murmured Louise, trembling, "shall I ever survive this
      cruel evening?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! do not frighten yourself in that manner," said Athenais; "we have
      found a remedy." So, seating herself between her two companions, and
      taking each of them by the hand, which she held in her own, she began. The
      first words were hardly spoke, when they heard a horse galloping away over
      the stones of the public high-road, outside the gates of the chateau.

    <h2>
      Chapter LV. Happy as a Prince.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the very moment he was about entering the chateau, Bragelonne met De
      Guiche. But before having been met by Raoul, De Guiche had met Manicamp,
      who had met Malicorne. How was it that Malicorne had met Manicamp? Nothing
      more simple, for he had awaited his return from mass, where he had
      accompanied M. de Saint-Aignan. When they met, they congratulated each
      other upon their good fortune, and Manicamp availed himself of the
      circumstance to ask his friend if he had not a few crowns still remaining
      at the bottom of his pocket. The latter, without expressing any surprise
      at the question, which he perhaps expected, answered that every pocket
      which is always being drawn upon without anything ever being put in it,
      resembles those wells which supply water during the winter, but which
      gardeners render useless by exhausting during the summer; that his,
      Malicorne's, pocket certainly was deep, and that there would be a pleasure
      in drawing on it in times of plenty, but that, unhappily, abuse had
      produced barrenness. To this remark, Manicamp, deep in thought, had
      replied, "Quite true!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The question, then, is how to fill it?" Malicorne added.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course; but in what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing easier, my dear Monsieur Manicamp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the better. How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A post in Monsieur's household, and the pocket is full again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have the post?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is, I have the promise of being nominated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but the promise of nomination, without the post itself, is like a
      purse with no money in it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true," Manicamp replied a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us try for the post, then," the candidate had persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear fellow," sighed Manicamp, "an appointment in his royal highness's
      household is one of the gravest difficulties of our position."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! oh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no question that, at the present moment, we cannot ask Monsieur
      for anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?" "Because we are not on good terms with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A great absurdity, too," said Malicorne, promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah! and if we were to show Madame any attention," said Manicamp,
      "frankly speaking, do you think we should please Monsieur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely; if we show Madame any attention, and do it adroitly, Monsieur
      ought to adore us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Either that or we are great fools. Make haste, therefore, M. Manicamp,
      you who are so able a politician, and make M. de Guiche and his royal
      highness friendly again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, what did M. de Saint-Aignan tell you, Malicorne?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me? nothing; he asked me several questions, and that was all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, was he less discreet, then, with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did he tell you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That the king is passionately in love with Mademoiselle de la Valliere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We knew that already," replied Malicorne, ironically; "and everybody
      talks about it loud enough for all to know it; but in the meantime, do
      what I advise you; speak to M. de Guiche, and endeavor to get him to make
      advances to Monsieur. Deuce take it! he owes his royal highness that, at
      least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we must see De Guiche, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There does not seem to be any great difficulty in that; try to see him in
      the same way I tried to see you; wait for him; you know that he is
      naturally very fond of walking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but whereabouts does he walk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a question to ask! Do you not know that he is in love with Madame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; you will find him walking about on the side of the chateau
      where her apartments are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay, my dear Malicorne, you were not mistaken, for here he is coming."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should I be mistaken? Have you ever noticed that I am in the habit of
      making a mistake? Come, we only need to understand each other. Are you in
      want of money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" exclaimed Manicamp, mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I want my appointment. Let Malicorne have the appointment, and
      Manicamp shall have the money. There is no greater difficulty in the way
      than that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; in that case make yourself easy. I will do my best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche approached, Malicorne stepped aside, and Manicamp caught hold of
      De Guiche, who was thoughtful and melancholy. "Tell me, my dear comte,
      what rhyme you were trying to find," said Manicamp. "I have an excellent
      one to match yours, particularly if yours ends in <i>ame</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche shook his head, and recognizing a friend, he took him by the
      arm. "My dear Manicamp," he said, "I am in search of something very
      different from a rhyme."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it you are looking for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will help me to find what I am in search of," continued the comte:
      "you who are such an idle fellow, in other words, a man with a mind full
      of ingenious devices."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am getting my ingenuity ready, then, my dear comte."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is the state of the case, then: I wish to approach a particular
      house, where I have some business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must get near the house, then," said Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good; but in this house dwells a husband who happens to be jealous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is he more jealous than the dog Cerberus?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not more, but quite as much so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has he three mouths, as that obdurate guardian of the infernal regions
      had? Do not shrug your shoulders, my dear comte: I put the question to you
      with an excellent reason, since poets pretend that, in order to soften
      Monsieur Cerberus, the visitor must take something enticing with him&mdash;a
      cake, for instance. Therefore, I, who view the matter in a prosaic light,
      that is to say in the light of reality, I say: one cake is very little for
      three mouths. If your jealous husband has three mouths, comte, get three
      cakes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Manicamp, I can get such advice as that from M. de Beautru."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In order to get better advice," said Manicamp, with a comical seriousness
      of expression, "you will be obliged to adopt a more precise formula than
      you have used towards me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Raoul were here," said De Guiche, "he would be sure to understand me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I think, particularly if you said to him: 'I should very much like to
      see Madame a little nearer, but I fear Monsieur, because he is jealous.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Manicamp!" cried the comte, angrily, and endeavoring to overwhelm his
      tormentor by a look, who did not, however, appear to be in the slightest
      degree disturbed by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter now, my dear comte?" inquired Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! is it thus you blaspheme the most sacred of names?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What names?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur! Madame! the highest names in the kingdom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very strangely mistaken, my dear comte. I never mentioned the
      highest names in the kingdom. I merely answered you in reference to the
      subject of a jealous husband, whose name you did not tell me, and who, as
      a matter of course, has a wife. I therefore replied to you, in order to
      see Madame, you must get a little more intimate with Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Double-dealer that you are," said the comte, smiling; "was that what you
      said?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good; what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," added Manicamp, "let the question be regarding the Duchess&mdash;or
      the Duke&mdash;; very well, I shall say: Let us get into the house in some
      way or other, for that is a tactic which cannot in any case be unfavorable
      to your love affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Manicamp, if you could but find me a pretext, a good pretext."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pretext; I can find you a hundred, nay, a thousand. If Malicorne were
      here, he would have already hit upon a thousand excellent pretexts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is Malicorne?" replied De Guiche, half-shutting his eyes, like a
      person reflecting, "I seem to know the name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Know him! I should think so: you owe his father thirty thousand crowns."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, indeed! so it's that worthy fellow from Orleans."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom you promised an appointment in Monsieur's household; not the jealous
      husband, but the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, since your friend Malicorne is such an inventive genius, let
      him find me a means of being adored by Monsieur, and a pretext to make my
      peace with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good: I'll talk to him about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who is that coming?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Vicomte de Bragelonne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Raoul! yes, it is he," said De Guiche, as he hastened forward to meet
      him. "You here, Raoul?" said De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes: I was looking for you to say farewell," replied Raoul, warmly,
      pressing the comte's hand. "How do you do, Monsieur Manicamp?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is this, vicomte, you are leaving us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, a mission from the king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To London. On leaving you, I am going to Madame; she has a letter to give
      me for his majesty, Charles II."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will find her alone, for Monsieur has gone out; gone to bathe, in
      fact."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, you, who are one of Monsieur's gentlemen in waiting, will
      undertake to make my excuses to him. I would have waited in order to
      receive any directions he might have to give me, if the desire for my
      immediate departure had not been intimated to me by M. Fouquet on behalf
      of his majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp touched De Guiche's elbow, saying, "There's a pretext for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Bragelonne's excuses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A weak pretext," said De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An excellent one, if Monsieur is not angry with you; but a paltry one if
      he bears you ill-will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, Manicamp; a pretext, however poor it may be, is all I
      require. And so, a pleasant journey to you, Raoul!" And the two friends
      took a warm leave of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes afterwards Raoul entered Madame's apartments, as Mademoiselle
      de Montalais had begged him to do. Madame was still seated at the table
      where she had written her letter. Before her was still burning the
      rose-colored taper she had used to seal it. Only in her deep reflection,
      for Madame seemed to be buried in thought, she had forgotten to extinguish
      the light. Bragelonne was a very model of elegance in every way; it was
      impossible to see him once without always remembering him; and not only
      had Madame seen him once, but it will not be forgotten he was one of the
      very first who had gone to meet her, and had accompanied her from Le Havre
      to Paris. Madame preserved therefore an excellent recollection of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! M. de Bragelonne," she said to him, "you are going to see my brother,
      who will be delighted to pay to the son a portion of the debt of gratitude
      he contracted with the father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Comte de la Fere, Madame, has been abundantly recompensed for the
      little service he had the happiness to render the king, by the kindness
      manifested towards him, and it is I who will have to convey to his majesty
      the assurance of the respect, devotion, and gratitude of both father and
      son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know my brother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, your highness; I shall have the honor of seeing his majesty for the
      first time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You require no recommendation to him. At all events, however, if you have
      any doubt about your personal merit, take me unhesitatingly for your
      surety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your royal highness overwhelms me with kindness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! M. de Bragelonne, I well remember that we were fellow-travelers once,
      and that I remarked your extreme prudence in the midst of the extravagant
      absurdities committed, on both sides, by two of the greatest simpletons in
      the world,&mdash;M. de Guiche and the Duke of Buckingham. Let us not speak
      of them, however; but of yourself. Are you going to England to remain
      there permanently? Forgive my inquiry: it is not curiosity, but a desire
      to be of service to you in anything I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Madame; I am going to England to fulfil a mission which his majesty
      has been kind enough to confide to me&mdash;nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you propose to return to France?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As soon as I have accomplished my mission; unless, indeed, his majesty,
      King Charles II., should have other orders for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He well beg you, at the very least, I am sure, to remain near him as long
      as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, as I shall not know how to refuse, I will now beforehand
      entreat your royal highness to have the goodness to remind the king of
      France that one of his devoted servants is far away from him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care that when you <i>are</i> recalled, you do not consider his
      command an abuse of power."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not understand you, Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The court of France is not easily matched, I am aware, but yet we have
      some pretty women at the court of England also."
    </p>
    <p>
      Raoul smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Madame, "yours is a smile which portends no good to my
      countrywomen. It is as though you were telling them, Monsieur de
      Bragelonne: 'I visit you, but I leave my heart on the other side of the
      Channel.' Did not your smile indicate that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness is gifted with the power of reading the inmost depths of
      the soul, and you will understand, therefore, why, at present, any
      prolonged residence at the court of England would be a matter of the
      deepest regret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I need not inquire if so gallant a knight is recompensed in return?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been brought up, Madame, with her whom I love, and I believe our
      affection is mutual."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, do not delay your departure, Monsieur de Bragelonne, and
      delay not your return, for on your return we shall see two persons happy;
      for I hope no obstacle exists to your felicity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a great obstacle, Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed! what is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king's wishes on the subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king opposes your marriage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He postpones it, at least. I solicited his majesty's consent through the
      Comte de la Fere, and, without absolutely refusing it, he positively said
      it must be deferred."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the young lady whom you love unworthy of you, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is worthy of a king's affection, Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean, she is not, perhaps, of birth equal to your own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her family is excellent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she young, beautiful?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is seventeen, and, in my opinion, exceedingly beautiful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is she in the country, or at Paris?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is here at Fontainebleau, Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the court?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I know her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has the honor to form one of your highness's household."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her name?" inquired the princess, anxiously; "if indeed," she added,
      hastily, "her name is not a secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Madame, my affection is too pure for me to make a secret of it to any
      one, and with still greater reason to your royal highness, whose kindness
      towards me has been so extreme. It is Mademoiselle Louise de la Valliere."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame could not restrain an exclamation, in which a feeling stronger than
      surprise might have been detected. "Ah!" she said, "La Valliere&mdash;she
      who yesterday&mdash;" she paused, and then continued, "she who was taken
      ill, I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Madame; it was only this morning that I heard of the accident that
      had befallen her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you see her before you came to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had the honor of taking leave of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you say," resumed Madame, making a powerful effort over herself,
      "that the king has&mdash;deferred your marriage with this young girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Madame, deferred it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he assign any reason for this postponement?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long is it since the Comte de la Fere preferred his request to the
      king?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More than a month, Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is very singular," said the princess, as something like a film clouded
      her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A month?" she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About a month."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right, vicomte," said the princess, with a smile, in which De
      Bragelonne might have remarked a kind of restraint; "my brother must not
      keep you too long in England; set off at once, and in the first letter I
      write to England, I will claim you in the king's name." And Madame rose to
      place her letter in Bragelonne's hands. Raoul understood that his audience
      was at an end; he took the letter, bowed lowly to the princess, and left
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A month!" murmured the princess; "could I have been blind, then, to so
      great an extent, and could he have loved her for this last month?" And as
      Madame had nothing to do, she sat down to begin a letter to her brother,
      the postscript of which was a summons for Bragelonne to return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Comte de Guiche, as we have seen, had yielded to the pressing
      persuasions of Manicamp, and allowed himself to be led to the stables,
      where they desired their horses to be got ready for them; then, by one of
      the side paths, a description of which has already been given, they
      advanced to meet Monsieur, who, having just finished bathing, was
      returning towards the chateau, wearing a woman's veil to protect his face
      from getting burnt by the sun, which was shining very brightly. Monsieur
      was in one of those fits of good humor to which the admiration of his own
      good looks sometimes gave occasion. As he was bathing he had been able to
      compare the whiteness of his body with that of the courtiers, and, thanks
      to the care which his royal highness took of himself, no one, not even the
      Chevalier de Lorraine, was able to stand the comparison. Monsieur,
      moreover, had been tolerably successful in swimming, and his muscles
      having been exercised by the healthy immersion in the cool water, he was
      in a light and cheerful state of mind and body. So that, at the sight of
      Guiche, who advanced to meet him at a hand gallop, mounted upon a
      magnificent white horse, the prince could not restrain an exclamation of
      delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think matters look well," said Manicamp, who fancied he could read this
      friendly disposition upon his royal highness's countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good day, De Guiche, good day," exclaimed the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Long life to your royal highness!" replied De Guiche, encouraged by the
      tone of Philip's voice; "health, joy, happiness, and prosperity to your
      highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Welcome, De Guiche, come on my right side, but keep your horse in hand,
      for I wish to return at a walking pace under the cool shade of these
      trees."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you please, monseigneur," said De Guiche, taking his place on the
      prince's right as he had been invited to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, my dear De Guiche," said the prince, "give me a little news of that
      De Guiche whom I used to know formerly, and who used to pay attentions to
      my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      Guiche blushed to the very whites of his eyes, while Monsieur burst out
      laughing, as though he had made the wittiest remark in the world. The few
      privileged courtiers who surrounded Monsieur thought it their duty to
      follow his example, although they had not heard the remark, and a noisy
      burst of laughter immediately followed, beginning with the first courtier,
      passing on through the whole company, and only terminating with the last.
      De Guiche, although blushing scarlet, put a good countenance on the
      matter; Manicamp looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! monseigneur," replied De Guiche, "show a little charity towards such
      a miserable fellow as I am: do not hold me up to the ridicule of the
      Chevalier de Lorraine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he hears you ridicule me, he will go beyond your highness, and will
      show no pity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "About your passion and the princess, do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For mercy's sake, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, De Guiche, confess that you <i>did</i> get a little sweet
      upon Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will never confess such a thing, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out of respect for me, I suppose; but I release you from your respect, De
      Guiche. Confess, as if it were simply a question about Mademoiselle de
      Chalais or Mademoiselle de la Valliere."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then breaking off, he said, beginning to laugh again, "Comte, that wasn't
      at all bad!&mdash;a remark like a sword, which cuts two ways at once. I
      hit you and my brother at the same time, Chalais and La Valliere, your
      affianced bride and his future lady love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, monseigneur," said the comte, "you are in a most brilliant humor
      to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is, I feel well, and then I am pleased to see you again. But you
      were angry with me, were you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, monseigneur? Why should I have been so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I interfered with your sarabands and your other Spanish
      amusements. Nay, do not deny it. On that day you left the princess's
      apartments with your eyes full of fury; that brought you ill-luck, for you
      danced in the ballet yesterday in a most wretched manner. Now don't get
      sulky, De Guiche, for it does you no good, but makes you look like a tame
      bear. If the princess did not look at you attentively yesterday, I am
      quite sure of one thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that, monseigneur? Your highness alarms me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She has quite forsworn you now," said the prince, with a burst of loud
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Decidedly," thought Manicamp, "rank has nothing to do with it, and all
      men are alike."
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince continued: "At all events, you have now returned, and it is to
      be hoped that the chevalier will become amiable again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so, monseigneur: and by what miracle can I exercise such an influence
      over M. de Lorraine?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The matter is very simple, he is jealous of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah! it is not possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the case, though."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He does me too much honor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is, that when you are here, he is full of kindness and
      attention, but when you are gone he makes me suffer a perfect martyrdom. I
      am like a see-saw. Besides, you do not know the idea that has struck me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not even suspect it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then; when you were in exile&mdash;for you really were exiled, my
      poor De Guiche&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should think so, indeed; but whose fault was it?" said De Guiche,
      pretending to speak in an angry tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not mine, certainly, my dear comte," replied his royal highness, "upon my
      honor, I did not ask for the king to exile you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, not you, monseigneur, I am well aware; but&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But Madame; well, as far as that goes, I do not say it was not the case.
      Why, what the deuce did you do or say to Madame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, monseigneur&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Women, I know, have their grudges, and my wife is not free from caprices
      of that nature. But if she were the cause of your being exiled I bear you
      no ill-will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, monseigneur," said De Guiche. "I am not altogether
      unhappy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Manicamp, who was following closely behind De Guiche and who did not lose
      a word of what the prince was saying, bent down to his very shoulders over
      his horse's neck, in order to conceal the laughter he could not repress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides, your exile started a project in my head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the chevalier&mdash;finding you were no longer here, and sure of
      reigning undisturbed&mdash;began to bully me, I, observing that my wife,
      in the most perfect contrast to him, was most kind and amiable towards me
      who had neglected her so much, the idea occurred to me of becoming a model
      husband&mdash;a rarity, a curiosity, at the court; and I had an idea of
      getting very fond of my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche looked at the prince with a stupefied expression of countenance,
      which was not assumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! monseigneur," De Guiche stammered out; "surely, that never seriously
      occurred to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed it did. I have some property that my brother gave me on my
      marriage; she has some money of her own, and not a little either, for she
      gets money from her brother and brother-in-law of England and France at
      the same time. Well! we should have left the court. I should have retired
      to my chateau at Villers-Cotterets, situated in the middle of a forest, in
      which we should have led a most sentimental life in the very same spot
      where my grandfather, Henry IV., sojourned with La Belle Gabrielle. What
      do you think of that idea, De Guiche?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, it is enough to make one shiver, monseigneur," replied De Guiche,
      who shuddered in reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! I see you would never be able to endure being exiled a second time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, monseigneur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not carry you off with us, as I had first intended."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, with you, monseigneur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; if the idea should occur to me again of taking a dislike to the
      court."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! do not let that make any difference, monseigneur; I would follow your
      highness to the end of the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Clumsy fellow that you are!" said Manicamp, grumblingly, pushing his
      horse towards De Guiche, so as almost to unseat him, and then, as he
      passed close to him, as if he had lost command over the horse, he
      whispered, "For goodness' sake, think what you are saying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it is agreed, then," said the prince; "since you are so devoted to
      me, I shall take you with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Anywhere, monseigneur," replied De Guiche in a joyous tone, "whenever you
      like, and at once, too. Are you ready?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And De Guiche, laughingly, gave his horse the rein, and galloped forward a
      few yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One moment," said the prince. "Let us go to the chateau first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, to take my wife, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?" asked De Guiche.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, since I tell you that it is a project of conjugal affection, it is
      necessary I should take my wife with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, monseigneur," replied the comte, "I am greatly concerned,
      but no De Guiche for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes.&mdash;Why do you take Madame with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I begin to fancy I love her," said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Guiche turned slightly pale, but endeavored to preserve his seeming
      cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you love Madame, monseigneur," he said, "that ought to be quite enough
      for you, and you have no further need of your friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not bad, not bad," murmured Manicamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, your fear of Madame has begun again," replied the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, monseigneur, I have experienced that to my cost; a woman who was the
      cause of my being exiled!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a revengeful disposition you have, De Guiche, how virulently you
      bear malice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should like the case to be your own, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Decidedly, then, that was the reason why you danced so badly yesterday;
      you wished to revenge yourself, I suppose, by trying to make Madame make a
      mistake in her dancing; ah! that is very paltry, De Guiche, and I will
      tell Madame of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may tell her whatever you please, monseigneur, for her highness
      cannot hate me more than she does."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense, you are exaggerating; and this because merely of the
      fortnight's sojourn in the country she imposed on you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur, a fortnight is a fortnight; and when the time is passed in
      getting sick and tired of everything, a fortnight is an eternity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that you will not forgive her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, De Guiche, be a better disposed fellow than that. I wish to
      make your peace with her; you will find, in conversing with her, that she
      has no malice or unkindness in her nature, and that she is very talented."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will see that she can receive her friends like a princess, and laugh
      like a citizen's wife; you will see that, when she pleases, she can make
      the pleasant hours pass like minutes. Come, De Guiche, you must really
      make up your differences with my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word," said Manicamp to himself, "the prince is a husband whose
      wife's name will bring him ill-luck, and King Candaules, of old, was a
      tiger beside his royal highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events," added the prince, "I am sure you will make it up with my
      wife: I guarantee you will do so. Only, I must show you the way now. There
      is nothing commonplace about her: it is not every one who takes her
      fancy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No resistance, De Guiche, or I shall get out of temper," replied the
      prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, since he will have it so," murmured Manicamp, in Guiche's ear, "do
      as he wants you to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, monseigneur," said the comte, "I obey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And to begin," resumed the prince, "there will be cards, this evening, in
      Madame's apartment; you will dine with me, and I will take you there with
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! as for that, monseigneur," objected De Guiche, "you will allow me to
      object."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, again! this is positive rebellion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame received me too indifferently, yesterday, before the whole court."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really!" said the prince, laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, so much so, indeed, that she did not even answer me when I addressed
      her; it may be a good thing to have no self-respect at all, but to have
      too little is not enough, as the saying is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Comte! after dinner, you will go to your own apartments and dress
      yourself, and then you will come to fetch me. I shall wait for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since your highness absolutely commands it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Positively."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will not lose his hold," said Manicamp; "these are the things to which
      husbands cling most obstinately. Ah! what a pity M. Moliere could not have
      heard this man; he would have turned him into verse if he had."
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince and his court, chatting in this manner, returned to the coolest
      apartments of the chateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the by," said De Guiche, as they were standing by the door, "I had a
      commission for your royal highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Execute it, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "M. de Bragelonne has, by the king's order, set off for London, and he
      charged me with his respects for you; monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pleasant journey to the vicomte, whom I like very much. Go and dress
      yourself, De Guiche, and come back for me. If you don't come back&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will happen, monseigneur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will have you sent to the Bastile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said De Guiche, laughing, "his royal highness, monseigneur, is
      decidedly the counterpart of her royal highness, Madame. Madame gets me
      sent into exile, because she does not care for me sufficiently; and
      monseigneur gets me imprisoned, because he cares for me too much. I thank
      monseigneur, and I thank Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come," said the prince, "you are a delightful companion, and you
      know I cannot do without you. Return as soon as you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; but I am in the humor to prove myself difficult to be pleased,
      in <i>my</i> turn, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, I will not return to your royal highness, except upon one condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Name it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to oblige the friend of one of my friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Malicorne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "An ugly name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But very well borne, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may be. Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I owe M. Malicorne a place in your household, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What kind of a place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any kind of a place; a supervision of some sort or another, for
      instance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That happens very fortunately, for yesterday I dismissed my chief usher
      of the apartments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will do admirably. What are his duties?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, except to look about and make his report."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sort of interior police?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, how excellently that will suit Malicorne," Manicamp ventured to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know the person we are speaking of, M. Manicamp?" inquired the
      prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Intimately, monseigneur. He is a friend of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your opinion is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That your highness could never get a better usher of the apartments than
      he will make."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much does the appointment bring in?" inquired the comte of the
      prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know at all, only I have always been told that he could make as
      much as he pleased when he was thoroughly in earnest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you call being thoroughly in earnest, prince?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It means, of course, when the functionary in question is a man who has
      his wits about him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case I think your highness will be content, for Malicorne is as
      sharp as the devil himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! the appointment will be an expensive one for me, in that case,"
      replied the prince, laughing. "You are making me a positive present,
      comte."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe so, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, go and announce to your M. Melicorne&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Malicorne, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall never get hold of that name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say Manicamp very well, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I ought to say Malicorne very well, too. The alliteration will help
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say what you like, monseigneur, I can promise you your inspector of
      apartments will not be annoyed; he has the very happiest disposition that
      can be met with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, my dear De Guiche, inform him of his nomination. But, stay&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, monseigneur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to see him beforehand; if he be as ugly as his name, I retract
      every word I have said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your highness knows him, for you have already seen him at the Palais
      Royal; nay, indeed, it was I who presented him to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, I remember now&mdash;not a bad-looking fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you must have noticed him, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, yes. You see, De Guiche, I do not wish that either my wife or
      myself should have ugly faces before our eyes. My wife will have all her
      maids of honor pretty; I, all the gentlemen about me good-looking. In this
      way, De Guiche, you see, that any children we may have will run a good
      chance of being pretty, if my wife and myself have handsome models before
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most magnificently argued, monseigneur," said Manicamp, showing his
      approval by look and voice at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for De Guiche, he very probably did not find the argument so
      convincing, for he merely signified his opinion by a gesture, which,
      moreover, exhibited in a marked manner some indecision of mind on the
      subject. Manicamp went off to inform Malicorne of the good news he had
      just learned. De Guiche seemed very unwilling to take his departure for
      the purpose of dressing himself. Monsieur, singing, laughing, and admiring
      himself, passed away the time until the dinner-hour, in a frame of mind
      that justified the proverb of "Happy as a prince."

    <h2>
      Chapter LVI. Story of a Dryad and a Naiad.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Every one had partaken of the banquet at the chateau, and afterwards
      assumed their full court dresses. The usual hour for the repast was five
      o'clock. If we say, then, that the repast occupied an hour, and the
      toilette two hours, everybody was ready about eight o'clock in the
      evening. Towards eight o'clock, then, the guests began to arrive at
      Madame's, for we have already intimated that it was Madame who "received"
      that evening. And at Madame's <i>soirees</i> no one failed to be present;
      for the evenings passed in her apartments always had that perfect charm
      about them which the queen, that pious and excellent princess, had not
      been able to confer upon her <i>reunions</i>. For, unfortunately, one of
      the advantages of goodness of disposition is that it is far less amusing
      than wit of an ill-natured character. And yet, let us hasten to add, that
      such a style of wit could not be assigned to Madame, for her disposition
      of mind, naturally of the very highest order, comprised too much true
      generosity, too many noble impulses and high-souled thoughts, to warrant
      her being termed ill-natured. But Madame was endowed with a spirit of
      resistance&mdash;a gift frequently fatal to its possessor, for it breaks
      where another disposition would have bent; the result was that blows did
      not become deadened upon her as upon what might be termed the
      cotton-wadded feelings of Maria Theresa. Her heart rebounded at each
      attack, and therefore, whenever she was attacked, even in a manner that
      almost stunned her, she returned blow for blow to any one imprudent enough
      to tilt against her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was this really maliciousness of disposition or simply waywardness of
      character? We regard those rich and powerful natures as like the tree of
      knowledge, producing good and evil at the same time; a double branch,
      always blooming and fruitful, of which those who wish to eat know how to
      detect the good fruit, and from which the worthless and frivolous die who
      have eaten of it&mdash;a circumstance which is by no means to be regarded
      as a great misfortune. Madame, therefore, who had a well-disguised plan in
      her mind of constituting herself the second, if not even the principal,
      queen of the court, rendered her receptions delightful to all, from the
      conversation, the opportunities of meeting, and the perfect liberty she
      allowed every one of making any remark he pleased, on the condition,
      however, that the remark was amusing or sensible. And it will hardly be
      believed, that, by that means, there was less talking among the society
      Madame assembled together than elsewhere. Madame hated people who talked
      much, and took a remarkably cruel revenge upon them, for she allowed them
      to talk. She disliked pretension, too, and never overlooked that defect,
      even in the king himself. It was more than a weakness of Monsieur, and the
      princess had undertaken the amazing task of curing him of it. As for the
      rest, poets, wits, beautiful women, all were received by her with the air
      of a mistress superior to her slaves. Sufficiently meditative in her
      liveliest humors to make even poets meditate; sufficiently pretty to
      dazzle by her attractions, even among the prettiest; sufficiently witty
      for the most distinguished persons who were present, to be listened to
      with pleasure&mdash;it will easily be believed that the <i>reunions</i>
      held in Madame's apartments must naturally have proved very attractive.
      All who were young flocked there, and when the king himself happens to be
      young, everybody at court is so too. And so, the older ladies of the
      court, the strong-minded women of the regency, or of the last reign,
      pouted and sulked at their ease; but others only laughed at the fits of
      sulkiness in which these venerable individuals indulged, who had carried
      the love of authority so far as even to take command of bodies of soldiers
      in the wars of the Fronde, in order, as Madame asserted, not to lose their
      influence over men altogether. As eight o'clock struck her royal highness
      entered the great drawing-room accompanied by her ladies in attendance,
      and found several gentlemen belonging to the court already there, having
      been waiting for some minutes. Among those who had arrived before the hour
      fixed for the reception she looked round for one who, she thought, ought
      to have been first in attendance, but he was not there. However, almost at
      the very moment she completed her investigation, Monsieur was announced.
      Monsieur looked splendid. All the precious stones and jewels of Cardinal
      Mazarin, which of course that minister could not do otherwise than leave;
      all the queen-mother's jewels as well as a few belonging to his wife&mdash;Monsieur
      wore them all, and he was as dazzling as the rising sun. Behind him
      followed De Guiche, with hesitating steps and an air of contrition
      admirably assumed; De Guiche wore a costume of French-gray velvet,
      embroidered with silver, and trimmed with blue ribbons: he wore also
      Mechlin lace as rare and beautiful in its own way as the jewels of
      Monsieur in theirs. The plume in his hat was red. Madame, too, wore
      several colors, and preferred red for embroidery, gray for dress, and blue
      for flowers. M. de Guiche, dressed as we have described, looked so
      handsome that he excited every one's observation. An interesting pallor of
      complexion, a languid expression of the eyes, his white hands seen through
      the masses of lace that covered them, the melancholy expression of his
      mouth&mdash;it was only necessary, indeed, to see M. de Guiche to admit
      that few men at the court of France could hope to equal him. The
      consequence was that Monsieur, who was pretentious enough to fancy he
      could eclipse a star even, if a star had adorned itself in a similar
      manner to himself, was, on the contrary, completely eclipsed in all
      imaginations, which are silent judges certainly, but very positive and
      firm in their convictions. Madame looked at De Guiche lightly, but light
      as her look had been, it brought a delightful color to his face. In fact,
      Madame found De Guiche so handsome and so admirably dressed, that she
      almost ceased regretting the royal conquest she felt she was on the point
      of escaping her. Her heart, therefore, sent the blood to her face.
      Monsieur approached her. He had not noticed the princess's blush, or if he
      had seen it, he was far from attributing it to its true cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame," he said, kissing his wife's hand, "there is some one present
      here, who has fallen into disgrace, an unhappy exile whom I venture to
      recommend to your kindness. Do not forget, I beg, that he is one of my
      best friends, and that a gentle reception of him will please me greatly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What exile? what disgraced person are you speaking of?" inquired Madame,
      looking all round, and not permitting her glance to rest more on the count
      than on the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the moment to present De Guiche, and the prince drew aside and
      let De Guiche pass him, who, with a tolerably well-assumed awkwardness of
      manner, approached Madame and made his reverence to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" exclaimed Madame, as if she were greatly surprised, "is M. de
      Guiche the disgraced individual you speak of, the exile in question?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, certainly," returned the duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed," said Madame, "he seems almost the only person here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are unjust, Madame," said the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. Come, forgive the poor fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive him what? What have I to forgive M. de Guiche?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, explain yourself, De Guiche. What do you wish to be forgiven?"
      inquired the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! her royal highness knows very well what it is," replied the latter,
      in a hypocritical tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come, give him your hand, Madame," said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it will give you any pleasure, Monsieur," and, with a movement of her
      eyes and shoulders, which it would be impossible to describe, Madame
      extended towards the young man her beautiful and perfumed hand, upon which
      he pressed his lips. It was evident that he did so for some little time,
      and that Madame did not withdraw her hand too quickly, for the duke added:
    </p>
    <p>
      "De Guiche is not wickedly disposed, Madame; so do not be afraid, he will
      not bite you."
    </p>
    <p>
      A pretext was given in the gallery by the duke's remark, which was not,
      perhaps, very laughable, for every one to laugh excessively. The situation
      was odd enough, and some kindly disposed persons had observed it. Monsieur
      was still enjoying the effect of his remark, when the king was announced.
      The appearance of the room at that moment was as follows:&mdash;in the
      center, before the fireplace, which was filled with flowers, Madame was
      standing up, with her maids of honor formed in two wings, on either side
      of her; around whom the butterflies of the court were fluttering. Several
      other groups were formed in the recesses of the windows, like soldiers
      stationed in their different towers who belong to the same garrison. From
      their respective places they could pick up the remarks which fell from the
      principal group. From one of these groups, the nearest to the fireplace,
      Malicorne, who had been at once raised to the dignity, through Manicamp
      and De Guiche, of the post of master of the apartments, and whose official
      costume had been ready for the last two months, was brilliant with gold
      lace, and shone upon Montalais, standing on Madame's extreme left, with
      all the fire of his eyes and splendor of his velvet. Madame was conversing
      with Mademoiselle de Chatillon and Mademoiselle de Crequy, who were next
      to her, and addressed a few words to Monsieur, who drew aside as soon as
      the king was announced. Mademoiselle de la Valliere, like Montalais, was
      on Madame's left hand, and the last but one on the line, Mademoiselle de
      Tonnay-Charente being on her right. She was stationed as certain bodies of
      troops are, whose weakness is suspected, and who are placed between two
      experienced regiments. Guarded in this manner by the companions who had
      shared her adventure, La Valliere, whether from regret at Raoul's
      departure, or still suffering from the emotion caused by recent events,
      which had begun to render her name familiar on the lips of the courtiers,
      La Valliere, we repeat, hid her eyes, red with weeping, behind her fan,
      and seemed to give the greatest attention to the remarks which Montalais
      and Athenais, alternately, whispered to her from time to time. As soon as
      the king's name was announced a general movement took place in the
      apartment. Madame, in her character as hostess, rose to receive the royal
      visitor; but as she rose, notwithstanding her preoccupation of mind, she
      glanced hastily towards her right; her glance, which the presumptuous De
      Guiche regarded as intended for himself, rested, as it swept over the
      whole circle, upon La Valliere, whose warm blush and restless emotion it
      instantly perceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king advanced to the middle of the group, which had now become a
      general one, by a movement which took place from the circumference to the
      center. Every head bowed low before his majesty, the ladies bending like
      frail, magnificent lilies before King Aquilo. There was nothing very
      severe, we will even say, nothing very royal that evening about the king,
      except youth and good looks. He wore an air of animated joyousness and
      good-humor which set all imaginations at work, and, thereupon, all present
      promised themselves a delightful evening, for no other reason than from
      having remarked the desire his majesty had to amuse himself in Madame's
      apartments. If there was any one in particular whose high spirits and
      good-humor equalled the king's, it was M. de Saint-Aignan, who was dressed
      in a rose-colored costume, with face and ribbons of the same color, and,
      in addition, particularly rose-colored in his ideas, for that evening M.
      de Saint-Aignan was prolific in jests. The circumstance which had given a
      new expansion to the numerous ideas germinating in his fertile brain was,
      that he had just perceived that Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente was, like
      himself, dressed in rose-color. We would not wish to say, however, that
      the wily courtier had not know beforehand that the beautiful Athenais was
      to wear that particular color; for he very well knew the art of unlocking
      the lips of a dress-maker or a lady's maid as to her mistress's
      intentions. He cast as many killing glances at Mademoiselle Athenais as he
      had bows of ribbons on his stockings and doublet; in other words he
      discharged a prodigious number. The king having paid Madame the customary
      compliments, and Madame having requested him to be seated, the circle was
      immediately formed. Louis inquired of Monsieur the particulars of the
      day's bathing; and stated, looking at the ladies present while he spoke,
      that certain poets were engaged turning into verse the enchanting
      diversion of the baths of Vulaines, and that one of them particularly, M.
      Loret, seemed to have been intrusted with the confidence of some
      water-nymph, as he had in his verses recounted many circumstances that
      were actually true&mdash;at which remark more than one lady present felt
      herself bound to blush. The king at this moment took the opportunity of
      looking round him at more leisure; Montalais was the only one who did not
      blush sufficiently to prevent her looking at the king, and she saw him fix
      his eyes devouringly on Mademoiselle de la Valliere. This undaunted maid
      of honor, Mademoiselle de Montalais, be it understood, forced the king to
      lower his gaze, and so saved Louise de la Valliere from a sympathetic
      warmth of feeling this gaze might possibly have conveyed. Louis was
      appropriated by Madame, who overwhelmed him with inquiries, and no one in
      the world knew how to ask questions better than she did. He tried,
      however, to render the conversation general, and, with the view of
      effecting this, he redoubled his attention and devotion to her. Madame
      coveted complimentary remarks, and, determined to procure them at any
      cost, she addressed herself to the king, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, your majesty, who is aware of everything which occurs in your
      kingdom, ought to know beforehand the verses confided to M. Loret by this
      nymph; will your majesty kindly communicate them to us?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame," replied the king, with perfect grace of manner, "I dare not&mdash;you,
      personally, might be in no little degree confused at having to listen to
      certain details&mdash;but Saint-Aignan tells a story well, and has a
      perfect recollection of the verses. If he does not remember them, he will
      invent. I can certify he is almost a poet himself." Saint-Aignan, thus
      brought prominently forward, was compelled to introduce himself as
      advantageously as possible. Unfortunately, however, for Madame, he thought
      of his own personal affairs only; in other words, instead of paying Madame
      the compliments she so much desired and relished, his mind was fixed upon
      making as much display as possible of his own good fortune. Again
      glancing, therefore, for the hundredth time at the beautiful Athenais, who
      carried into practice her previous evening's theory of not even deigning
      to look at her adorer, he said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty will perhaps pardon me for having too indifferently
      remembered the verses which the nymph dictated to Loret; but if the king
      has not retained any recollection of them, how could I possibly remember?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame did not receive this shortcoming of the courtier very favorably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! madame," added Saint-Aignan, "at present it is no longer a question
      what the water-nymphs have to say; and one would almost be tempted to
      believe that nothing of any interest now occurs in those liquid realms. It
      is upon earth, madame, important events happen. Ah! Madame, upon the
      earth, how many tales are there full of&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Madame, "and what is taking place upon the earth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That question must be asked of the Dryads," replied the comte; "the
      Dryads inhabit the forest, as your royal highness is aware."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am aware also, that they are naturally very talkative, Monsieur de
      Saint-Aignan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such is the case, Madame; but when they say such delightful things, it
      would be ungracious to accuse them of being too talkative."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do they talk so delightfully, then?" inquired the princess,
      indifferently. "Really, Monsieur de Saint-Aignan, you excite my curiosity;
      and, if I were the king, I would require you immediately to tell us what
      the delightful things are these Dryads have been saying, since you alone
      seem to understand their language."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am at his majesty's orders, Madame, in that respect," replied the
      comte, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a fortunate fellow this Saint-Aignan is to understand the language
      of the Dryads," said Monsieur.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand it perfectly, monseigneur, as I do my own language."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell us all about them, then," said Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king felt embarrassed, for his confidant was, in all probability,
      about to embark in a difficult matter. He felt that it would be so, from
      the general attention excited by Saint-Aignan's preamble, and aroused too
      by Madame's peculiar manner. The most reserved of those who were present
      seemed ready to devour every syllable the comte was about to pronounce.
      They coughed, drew closer together, looked curiously at some of the maids
      of honor, who, in order to support with greater propriety, or with more
      steadiness, the fixity of the inquisitorial looks bent upon them, adjusted
      their fans accordingly, and assumed the bearing of a duelist about to be
      exposed to his adversary's fire. At this epoch, the fashion of ingeniously
      constructed conversations, and hazardously dangerous recitals, so
      prevailed, that, where, in modern times, a whole company assembled in a
      drawing-room would begin to suspect some scandal, or disclosure, or tragic
      event, and would hurry away in dismay, Madame's guests quietly settled
      themselves in their places, in order not to lose a word or gesture of the
      comedy composed by Monsieur de Saint-Aignan for their benefit, and the
      termination of which, whatever the style and the plot might be, must, as a
      matter of course, be marked by the most perfect propriety. The comte as
      known as a man of extreme refinement, and an admirable narrator. He
      courageously began, then, amidst a profound silence, which would have been
      formidable to any one but himself:&mdash;"Madame, by the king's
      permission, I address myself, in the first place, to your royal highness,
      since you admit yourself to be the person present possessing the greatest
      curiosity. I have the honor, therefore, to inform your royal highness that
      the Dryad more particularly inhabits the hollows of oaks; and, as Dryads
      are mythological creatures of great beauty, they inhabit the most
      beautiful trees, in other words, the largest to be found."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this exordium, which recalled, under a transparent veil, the celebrated
      story of the royal oak, which had played so important a part in the last
      evening, so many hearts began to beat, both from joy and uneasiness, that,
      if Saint-Aignan had not had a good and sonorous voice, their throbbings
      might have been heard above the sound of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There must surely be Dryads at Fontainebleau, then," said Madame, in a
      perfectly calm voice; "for I have never, in all my life, seen finer oaks
      than in the royal park." And as she spoke, she directed towards De Guiche
      a look of which he had no reason to complain, as he had of the one that
      preceded it; which, as we have already mentioned, had reserved a certain
      amount of indefiniteness most painful for so loving a heart as his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely, Madame, it is of Fontainebleau I was about to speak to your
      royal highness," said Saint-Aignan; "for the Dryad whose story is engaging
      our attention, lives in the park belonging to the chateau of his majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair was fairly embarked on; the action was begun, and it was no
      longer possible for auditory or narrator to draw back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be worth listening to," said Madame; "for the story not only
      appears to me to have all the interest of a national incident, but still
      more, seems to be a circumstance of very recent occurrence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to begin at the beginning," said the comte. "In the first place,
      then, there lived at Fontainebleau, in a cottage of modest and unassuming
      appearance, two shepherds. The one was the shepherd Tyrcis, the owner of
      extensive domains transmitted to him from his parents, by right of
      inheritance. Tyrcis was young and handsome, and, from his many
      qualifications, he might be pronounced to be the first and foremost among
      the shepherds in the whole country; one might even boldly say he was the
      king of shepherds." A subdued murmur of approbation encouraged the
      narrator, who continued:&mdash;"His strength equals his courage; no one
      displays greater address in hunting wild beasts, nor greater wisdom in
      matters where judgment is required. Whenever he mounts and exercises his
      horse in the beautiful plains of his inheritance, or whenever he joins
      with the shepherds who owe him allegiance, in different games of skill and
      strength, one might say that it is the god Mars hurling his lance on the
      plains of Thrace, or, even better, that it was Apollo himself, the god of
      day, radiant upon earth, bearing his flaming darts in his hand." Every one
      understood that this allegorical portrait of the king was not the worst
      exordium the narrator could have chosen; and consequently it did not fail
      to produce its effect, either upon those who, from duty or inclination,
      applauded it to the very echo, or on the king himself, to whom flattery
      was very agreeable when delicately conveyed, and whom, indeed, it did not
      always displease, even when it was a little too broad. Saint-Aignan then
      continued:&mdash;"It is not in games of glory only, ladies, that the
      shepherd Tyrcis had acquired that reputation by which he was regarded as
      the king of the shepherds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of the shepherds of Fontainebleau," said the king, smilingly, to Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" exclaimed Madame, "Fontainebleau is selected arbitrarily by the
      poet; but I should say, of the shepherds of the whole world." The king
      forgot his part of a passive auditor, and bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," paused Saint-Aignan, amidst a flattering murmur of applause, "it
      is with ladies fair especially that the qualities of this king of the
      shepherds are most prominently displayed. He is a shepherd with a mind as
      refined as his heart is pure; he can pay a compliment with a charm of
      manner whose fascination it is impossible to resist; and in his
      attachments he is so discreet, that beautiful and happy conquests may
      regard their lot as more than enviable. Never a syllable of disclosure,
      never a moment's forgetfulness. Whoever has seen and heard Tyrcis must
      love him; whoever loves and is beloved by him, has indeed found
      happiness." Saint-Aignan here paused; he was enjoying the pleasure of all
      these compliments; and the portrait he had drawn, however grotesquely
      inflated it might be, had found favor in certain ears, in which the
      perfections of the shepherd did not seem to have been exaggerated. Madame
      begged the orator to continue. "Tyrcis," said the comte, "had a faithful
      companion, or rather a devoted servant, whose name was&mdash;Amyntas."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Madame, archly, "now for the portrait of Amyntas; you are such
      an excellent painter, Monsieur de Saint-Aignan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! comte, do not, I entreat you, sacrifice poor Amyntas; I should never
      forgive you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, Amyntas is of too humble a position, particularly beside Tyrcis,
      for his person to be honored by a parallel. There are certain friends who
      resemble those followers of ancient times, who caused themselves to be
      buried alive at their masters' feet. Amyntas's place, too, is at the feet
      of Tyrcis; he cares for no other; and if, sometimes, the illustrious hero&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Illustrious shepherd, you mean?" said Madame, pretending to correct M. de
      Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your royal highness is right; I was mistaken," returned the courtier;
      "if, I say, the shepherd Tyrcis deigns occasionally to call Amyntas his
      friend, and to open his heart to him, it is an unparalleled favor, which
      the latter regards as the most unbounded felicity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All that you say," interrupted Madame, "establishes the extreme devotion
      of Amyntas to Tyrcis, but does not furnish us with the portrait of
      Amyntas. Comte, do not flatter him, if you like; but describe him to us. I
      will have Amyntas's portrait." Saint-Aignan obeyed, after having bowed
      profoundly to his majesty's sister-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amyntas," he said, "is somewhat older than Tyrcis; he is not an
      ill-favored shepherd; it is even said that the muses condescended to smile
      upon him at his birth, even as Hebe smiled upon youth. He is not ambitious
      of display, but he is ambitious of being loved; and he might not, perhaps,
      be found unworthy of it, if he were only sufficiently well-known."
    </p>
    <p>
      This latter paragraph, strengthened by a killing glance, was directed
      straight to Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, who received them both
      unmoved. But the modesty and tact of the allusion had produced a good
      effect; Amyntas reaped the benefit of it in the applause bestowed upon
      him: Tyrcis's head even gave the signal for it by a consenting bow, full
      of good feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One evening," continued Saint-Aignan, "Tyrcis and Amyntas were walking
      together in the forest, talking of their love disappointments. Do not
      forget, ladies, that the story of the Dryad is now beginning, otherwise it
      would be easy to tell you what Tyrcis and Amyntas, the two most discreet
      shepherds of the whole earth, were talking about. They reached the
      thickest part of the forest, for the purpose of being quite alone, and of
      confiding their troubles more freely to each other, when suddenly the
      sound of voices struck upon their ears."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, ah!" said those who surrounded the narrator. "Nothing can be more
      interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, Madame, like a vigilant general inspecting his army,
      glanced at Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, who could not help wincing as
      they drew themselves up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These harmonious voices," resumed Saint-Aignan, "were those of certain
      shepherdesses, who had been likewise desirous of enjoying the coolness of
      the shade, and who, knowing the isolated and almost unapproachable
      situation of the place, had betaken themselves there to interchange their
      ideas upon&mdash;" A loud burst of laughter occasioned by this remark of
      Saint-Aignan, and an imperceptible smile of the king, as he looked at
      Tonnay-Charente, followed this sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Dryad affirms positively," continued Saint-Aignan, "that the
      shepherdesses were three in number, and that all three were young and
      beautiful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What were their names?" said Madame, quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Their names?" said Saint-Aignan, who hesitated from fear of committing an
      indiscretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course; you call your shepherds Tyrcis and Amyntas; give your
      shepherdesses names in a similar manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Madame, I am not an inventor; I relate simply what took place as the
      Dryad related it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did your Dryad, then, call these shepherdesses? You have a very
      treacherous memory, I fear. This Dryad must have fallen out with the
      goddess Mnemosyne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "These shepherdesses, Madame? Pray remember that it is a crime to betray a
      woman's name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From which a woman absolves you, comte, on the condition that you will
      reveal the names of the shepherdesses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Their names were Phyllis, Amaryllis, and Galatea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exceedingly well!&mdash;they have not lost by the delay," said Madame,
      "and now we have three charming names. But now for their portraits."
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan again made a slight movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, comte, let us proceed in due order," returned Madame. "Ought we not,
      sire, to have the portraits of the shepherdesses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, who expected this determined perseverance, and who began to feel
      some uneasiness, did not think it safe to provoke so dangerous an
      interrogator. He thought, too, that Saint-Aignan, in drawing the
      portraits, would find a means of insinuating some flattering allusions
      which would be agreeable to the ears of one his majesty was interested in
      pleasing. It was with this hope and with this fear that Louis authorized
      Saint-Aignan to sketch the portraits of the shepherdesses, Phyllis,
      Amaryllis, and Galatea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, then; be it so," said Saint-Aignan, like a man who has made up
      his mind, and he began.

    <h2>
      Chapter LVII. Conclusion of the Story of a Naiad and of a Dryad.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Phyllis," said Saint-Aignan, with a glance of defiance at Montalais, such
      as a fencing-master would give who invites an antagonist worthy of him to
      place himself on guard, "Phyllis is neither fair nor dark, neither tall
      nor short, neither too grave nor too gay; though but a shepherdess, she is
      as witty as a princess, and as coquettish as the most finished flirt that
      ever lived. Nothing can equal her excellent vision. Her heart yearns for
      everything her gaze embraces. She is like a bird, which, always warbling,
      at one moment skims the ground, at the next rises fluttering in pursuit of
      a butterfly, then rests itself upon the topmost branch of a tree, where it
      defies the bird-catchers either to come and seize it or to entrap it in
      their nets." The portrait bore such a strong resemblance to Montalais,
      that all eyes were directed towards her; she, however, with her head
      raised, and with a steady, unmoved look, listened to Saint-Aignan, as if
      he were speaking of an utter stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that all, Monsieur de Saint-Aignan?" inquired the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! your royal highness, the portrait is but a mere sketch, and many more
      additions could be made, but I fear to weary your patience, or offend the
      modesty of the shepherdess, and I shall therefore pass on to her
      companion, Amaryllis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said Madame, "pass on to Amaryllis, Monsieur de Saint-Aignan,
      we are all attention."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amaryllis is the eldest of the three, and yet," Saint-Aignan hastened to
      add, "this advanced age does not reach twenty years."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, who had slightly knitted her brows at the
      commencement of the description, unbent them with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is tall, with an astonishing abundance of beautiful hair, which she
      fastens in the manner of the Grecian statues; her walk is full of majesty,
      her attitude haughty; she has the air, therefore, rather of a goddess than
      a mere mortal, and among the goddesses, she most resembles Diana the
      huntress; with this sole difference, however, that the cruel shepherdess,
      having stolen the quiver of young love, while poor Cupid was sleeping in a
      thicket of roses, instead of directing her arrows against the inhabitants
      of the forest, discharges them pitilessly against all poor shepherds who
      pass within reach of her bow and of her eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! what a wicked shepherdess!" said Madame. "She may some day wound
      herself with one of those arrows she discharges, as you say, so
      mercilessly on all sides."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the hope of shepherds, one and all!" said Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that of the shepherd Amyntas in particular, I suppose?" said Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The shepherd Amyntas is so timid," said Saint-Aignan, with the most
      modest air he could assume, "that if he cherishes such a hope as that, no
      one has ever known anything about it, for he conceals it in the very
      depths of his heart." A flattering murmur of applause greeted this
      profession of faith on behalf of the shepherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Galatea?" inquired Madame. "I am impatient to see a hand so skillful
      as yours continue the portrait where Virgil left it, and finish it before
      our eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame," said Saint-Aignan, "I am indeed a poor dumb post beside the
      mighty Virgil. Still, encouraged by your desire, I will do my best."
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan extended his foot and hand, and thus began:&mdash;"White as
      milk, she casts upon the breeze the perfume of her fair hair tinged with
      golden hues, as are the ears of corn. One is tempted to inquire if she is
      not the beautiful Europa, who inspired Jupiter with a tender passion as
      she played with her companions in the flower-spangled meadows. From her
      exquisite eyes, blue as azure heaven on the clearest summer day, emanates
      a tender light, which reverie nurtures, and love dispenses. When she
      frowns, or bends her looks towards the ground, the sun is veiled in token
      of mourning. When she smiles, on the contrary, nature resumes her jollity,
      and the birds, for a brief moment silenced, recommence their songs amid
      the leafy covert of the trees. Galatea," said Saint-Aignan, in conclusion,
      "is worthy of the admiration of the whole world; and if she should ever
      bestow her heart upon another, happy will that man be to whom she
      consecrates her first affections."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame, who had attentively listened to the portrait Saint-Aignan had
      drawn, as, indeed, had all the others, contented herself with accentuating
      her approbation of the most poetic passage by occasional inclinations of
      her head; but it was impossible to say if these marks of assent were
      accorded to the ability of the narrator of the resemblance of the
      portrait. The consequence, therefore, was, that as Madame did not openly
      exhibit any approbation, no one felt authorized to applaud, not even
      Monsieur, who secretly thought that Saint-Aignan dwelt too much upon the
      portraits of the shepherdesses, and had somewhat slightingly passed over
      the portraits of the shepherds. The whole assembly seemed suddenly
      chilled. Saint-Aignan, who had exhausted his rhetorical skill and his
      palette of artistic tints in sketching the portrait of Galatea, and who,
      after the favor with which his other descriptions had been received,
      already imagined he could hear the loudest applause allotted to this last
      one, was himself more disappointed than the king and the rest of the
      company. A moment's silence followed, which was at last broken by Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir," she inquired, "What is your majesty's opinion of these three
      portraits?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, who wished to relieve Saint-Aignan's embarrassment without
      compromising himself, replied, "Why, Amaryllis, in my opinion, is
      beautiful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For my part," said Monsieur, "I prefer Phyllis; she is a capital girl, or
      rather a good-sort-of-fellow of a nymph."
    </p>
    <p>
      A gentle laugh followed, and this time the looks were so direct, that
      Montalais felt herself blushing almost scarlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," resumed Madame, "what were those shepherdesses saying to each
      other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan, however, whose vanity had been wounded, did not feel himself
      in a position to sustain an attack of new and refreshed troops, and merely
      said, "Madame, the shepherdesses were confiding to one another their
      little preferences."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay! Monsieur de Saint-Aignan, you are a perfect stream of pastoral
      poesy," said Madame, with an amiable smile, which somewhat comforted the
      narrator.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They confessed that love is a mighty peril, but that the absence of love
      is the heart's sentence of death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was the conclusion they came to?" inquired Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They came to the conclusion that love was necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good! Did they lay down any conditions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That of choice, simply," said Saint-Aignan. "I ought even to add,&mdash;remember
      it is the Dryad who is speaking,&mdash;that one of the shepherdesses,
      Amaryllis, I believe, was completely opposed to the necessity of loving,
      and yet she did not positively deny that she had allowed the image of a
      certain shepherd to take refuge in her heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it Amyntas or Tyrcis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amyntas, Madame," said Saint-Aignan, modestly. "But Galatea, the gentle
      and soft-eyed Galatea, immediately replied, that neither Amyntas, nor
      Alphesiboeus, nor Tityrus, nor indeed any of the handsomest shepherds of
      the country, were to be compared to Tyrcis; that Tyrcis was as superior to
      all other men, as the oak to all other trees, as the lily in its majesty
      to all other flowers. She drew even such a portrait of Tyrcis that Tyrcis
      himself, who was listening, must have felt truly flattered at it,
      notwithstanding his rank as a shepherd. Thus Tyrcis and Amyntas had been
      distinguished by Phyllis and Galatea; and thus had the secrets of two
      hearts revealed beneath the shades of evening, and amid the recesses of
      the woods. Such, Madame, is what the Dryad related to me; she who knows
      all that takes place in the hollows of oaks and grassy dells; she who
      knows the loves of the birds, and all they wish to convey by their songs;
      she who understands, in fact, the language of the wind among the branches,
      the humming of the insect with its gold and emerald wings in the corolla
      of the wild-flowers; it was she who related the particulars to me, and I
      have repeated them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now you have finished, Monsieur de Saint-Aignan, have you not?" said
      Madame, with a smile that made the king tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite finished," replied Saint-Aignan, "and but too happy if I have been
      able to amuse your royal highness for a few moments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moments which have been too brief," replied the princess; "for you have
      related most admirably all you know; but, my dear Monsieur de
      Saint-Aignan, you have been unfortunate enough to obtain your information
      from one Dryad only, I believe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Madame, only from one, I confess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact was, that you passed by a little Naiad, who pretended to know
      nothing at all, and yet knew a great deal more than your Dryad, my dear
      comte."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Naiad!" repeated several voices, who began to suspect that the story
      had a continuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course close beside the oak you are speaking of, which, if I am not
      mistaken, is called the royal oak&mdash;is it not so, Monsieur de
      Saint-Aignan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan and the king exchanged glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Madame," the former replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, close beside the oak there is a pretty little spring, which runs
      murmuringly over the pebbles, between banks of forget-me-nots and
      daffodils."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you are correct," said the king, with some uneasiness, and
      listening with some anxiety to his sister-in-law's narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! there is one, I can assure you," said Madame; "and the proof of it
      is, that the Naiad who resides in that little stream stopped me as I was
      about to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah?" said Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed," continued the princess, "and she did so in order to
      communicate to me many particulars Monsieur de Saint-Aignan has omitted in
      his recital."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray relate them yourself, then," said Monsieur, "you can relate stories
      in such a charming manner." The princess bowed at the conjugal compliment
      paid her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not possess the poetical powers of the comte, nor his ability to
      bring to light the smallest details."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will not be listened to with less interest on that account," said the
      king, who already perceived that something hostile was intended in his
      sister-in-law's story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I speak, too," continued Madame, "in the name of that poor little Naiad,
      who is indeed the most charming creature I ever met. Moreover, she laughed
      so heartily while she was telling me her story, that, in pursuance of that
      medical axiom that laughter is the finest physic in the world, I ask
      permission to laugh a little myself when I recollect her words."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king and Saint-Aignan, who noticed spreading over many of the faces
      present a distant and prophetic ripple of the laughter Madame announced,
      finished by looking at each other, as if asking themselves whether there
      was not some little conspiracy concealed beneath these words. But Madame
      was determined to turn the knife in the wound over and over again; she
      therefore resumed with the air of the most perfect candor, in other words,
      with the most dangerous of all her airs: "Well, then, I passed that way,"
      she said, "and as I found beneath my steps many fresh flowers newly blown,
      no doubt Phyllis, Amaryllis, Galatea, and all your shepherdesses had
      passed the same way before me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king bit his lips, for the recital was becoming more and more
      threatening. "My little Naiad," continued Madame, "was cooing over her
      quaint song in the bed of the rivulet; as I perceived that she accosted me
      by touching the hem of my dress, I could not think of receiving her
      advances ungraciously, and more particularly so, since, after all, a
      divinity, even though she be of a second grade, is always of greater
      importance than a mortal, though a princess. I thereupon accosted the
      Naiad, and bursting into laughter, this is what she said to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Fancy, princess...' You understand, sire, it is the Naiad who is
      speaking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The king bowed assentingly; and Madame continued:&mdash;"'Fancy, princess,
      the banks of my little stream have just witnessed a most amusing scene.
      Two shepherds, full of curiosity, even indiscreetly so, have allowed
      themselves to be mystified in a most amusing manner by three nymphs, or
      three shepherdesses,'&mdash;I beg your pardon, but I do not now remember
      if it was nymphs or shepherdesses she said; but it does not much matter,
      so we will continue."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, at this opening, colored visibly, and Saint-Aignan, completely
      losing countenance, began to open his eyes in the greatest possible
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The two shepherds,' pursued my nymph, still laughing, 'followed in the
      wake of the three young ladies,'&mdash;no, I mean, of the three nymphs;
      forgive me, I ought to say, of the three shepherdesses. It is not always
      wise to do that, for it may be awkward for those who are followed. I
      appeal to all the ladies present, and not one of them, I am sure, will
      contradict me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, who was much disturbed by what he suspected was about to follow,
      signified his assent by a gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'But,' continued the Naiad, 'the shepherdesses had noticed Tyrcis and
      Amyntas gliding into the wood, and, by the light of the moon, they had
      recognized them through the grove of the trees.' Ah, you laugh!"
      interrupted Madame; "wait, wait, you are not yet at the end."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king turned pale; Saint-Aignan wiped his forehead, now dewed with
      perspiration. Among the groups of ladies present could be heard smothered
      laughter and stealthy whispers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'The shepherdesses, I was saying, noticing how indiscreet the two
      shepherds were, proceeded to sit down at the foot of the royal oak; and,
      when they perceived that their over-curious listeners were sufficiently
      near, so that not a syllable of what they might say could be lost, they
      addressed towards them very innocently, in the most artless manner in the
      world indeed, a passionate declaration, which from the vanity natural to
      all men, and even to the most sentimental of shepherds, seemed to the two
      listeners as sweet as honey.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, at these words, which the assembly was unable to hear without
      laughing, could not restrain a flash of anger darting from his eyes. As
      for Saint-Aignan, he let his head fall upon his breast, and concealed,
      under a silly laugh, the extreme annoyance he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," said the king, drawing himself up to his full height, "upon my word,
      that is a most amusing jest, certainly; but, really and truly, are you
      sure you quite understood the language of the Naiads?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The comte, sire, pretends to have perfectly understood that of the
      Dryads," retorted Madame, icily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt," said the king; "but you know the comte has the weakness to
      aspire to become a member of the Academy, so that, with this object in
      view, he has learnt all sorts of things of which very happily you are
      ignorant; and it might possibly happen that the language of the Nymph of
      the Waters might be among the number of things you have not studied."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, sire," replied Madame, "for facts of that nature one does not
      altogether rely upon one's self alone; a woman's ear is not infallible, so
      says Saint Augustine; and I, therefore, wished to satisfy myself by other
      opinions beside my own, and as my Naiad, who, in her character of a
      goddess, is polyglot,&mdash;is not that the expression, M. de
      Saint-Aignan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe so," said the latter, quite out of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," continued the princess, "as my Naiad, who, in her character of a
      goddess, had, at first spoken to me in English, I feared, as you suggest,
      that I might have misunderstood her, and I requested Mesdemoiselles de
      Montalais, de Tonnay-Charente, and de la Valliere, to come to me, begging
      my Naiad to repeat to me in the French language, the recital she had
      already communicated to me in English."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did she do so?" inquired the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, she is the most polite divinity it is possible to imagine! Yes, sire,
      she did so; so that no doubt whatever remains on the subject. Is it not
      so, young ladies?" said the princess, turning towards the left of her
      army; "did not the Naiad say precisely what I have related, and have I, in
      any one particular, exceeded the truth, Phyllis? I beg your pardon, I mean
      Mademoiselle Aure de Montalais?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely as you have stated, Madame," articulated Mademoiselle de
      Montalais, very distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it true, Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The perfect truth," replied Athenais, in a voice quite as firm, but not
      yet so distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you, La Valliere?" asked Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl felt the king's ardent look fixed upon her,&mdash;she dared
      not deny&mdash;she dared not tell a falsehood; she merely bowed her head;
      and everybody took it for a token of assent. Her head, however, was not
      raised again, chilled as she was by a coldness more bitter than that of
      death. This triple testimony overwhelmed the king. As for Saint-Aignan, he
      did not even attempt to dissemble his despair, and, hardly knowing what he
      said, he stammered out, "An excellent jest! admirably played!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A just punishment for curiosity," said the king, in a hoarse voice. "Oh!
      who would think, after the chastisement that Tyrcis and Amyntas had
      suffered, of endeavoring to surprise what is passing in the heart of
      shepherdesses? Assuredly I shall not, for one; and, you, gentlemen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I! nor I!" repeated, in a chorus, the group of courtiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame was filled with triumph at the king's annoyance; and was full of
      delight, thinking that her story had been, or was to be, the termination
      of the whole affair. As for Monsieur, who had laughed at the two stories
      without comprehending anything about them, he turned towards De Guiche,
      and said to him, "Well, comte, you say nothing; can you not find something
      to say? Do you pity M. Tyrcis and M. Amyntas, for instance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pity them with all my soul," replied De Guiche; "for, in very truth,
      love is so sweet a fancy, that to lose it, fancy though it may be, is to
      lose more than life itself. If, therefore, these two shepherds thought
      themselves beloved,&mdash;if they were happy in that idea, and if, instead
      of that happiness, they meet not only that empty void which resembles
      death, but jeers and jests at love itself, which is worse than a thousand
      deaths,&mdash;in that case, I say that Tyrcis and Amyntas are the two most
      unhappy men I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are right, too, Monsieur de Guiche," said the king; "for, in
      fact, the injury in question is a very hard return for a little harmless
      curiosity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is as much to say, then, that the story of my Naiad has displeased
      the king?" asked Madame, innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, Madame, undeceive yourself," said Louis, taking the princess by the
      hand; "your Naiad, on the contrary, has pleased me, and the more so,
      because she was so truthful, and because her tale, I ought to add, is
      confirmed by the testimony of unimpeachable witnesses."
    </p>
    <p>
      These words fell upon La Valliere, accompanied by a look that on one, from
      Socrates to Montaigne, could have exactly defined. The look and the king's
      remark succeeded in overpowering the unhappy girl, who, with her head upon
      Montalais's shoulder, seemed to have fainted away. The king rose, without
      remarking this circumstance, of which no one, moreover, took any notice,
      and, contrary to his usual custom, for generally he remained late in
      Madame's apartments, he took his leave, and retired to his own side of the
      palace. Saint-Aignan followed him, leaving the rooms in as much despair as
      he had entered them with delight. Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, less
      sensitive than La Valliere, was not much frightened, and did not faint.
      However, it may be that the last look of Saint-Aignan had hardly been so
      majestic as the king's.

    <h2>
      Chapter LVIII. Royal Psychology.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king returned to his apartments with hurried steps. The reason he
      walked as fast as he did was probably to avoid tottering in his gait. He
      seemed to leave behind him as he went along a trace of a mysterious
      sorrow. That gayety of manner, which every one had remarked in him on his
      arrival, and which they had been delighted to perceive, had not perhaps
      been understood in its true sense: but his stormy departure, his
      disordered countenance, all knew, or at least thought they could tell the
      reason of. Madame's levity of manner, her somewhat bitter jests,&mdash;bitter
      for persons of a sensitive disposition, and particularly for one of the
      king's character; the great resemblance which naturally existed between
      the king and an ordinary mortal, were among the reasons assigned for the
      precipitate and unexpected departure of his majesty. Madame, keen-sighted
      enough in other respects, did not, however, at first see anything
      extraordinary in it. It was quite sufficient for her to have inflicted
      some slight wound upon the vanity or self-esteem of one who, so soon
      forgetting the engagements he had contracted, seemed to have undertaken to
      disdain, without cause, the noblest and highest prize in France. It was
      not an unimportant matter for Madame, in the present position of affairs,
      to let the king perceive the difference which existed between the bestowal
      of his affections on one in a high station, and the running after each
      passing fancy, like a youth fresh from the provinces. With regard to those
      higher placed affections, recognizing their dignity and their illimitable
      influence, acknowledging in them a certain etiquette and display&mdash;a
      monarch not only did not act in a manner derogatory to his high position,
      but found even repose, security, mystery, and general respect therein. On
      the contrary, in the debasement of a common or humble attachment, he would
      encounter, even among his meanest subjects, carping and sarcastic remarks;
      he would forfeit his character of infallibility and inviolability. Having
      descended to the region of petty human miseries, he would be subjected to
      paltry contentions. In one word, to convert the royal divinity into a mere
      mortal by striking at his heart, or rather even at his face, like the
      meanest of his subjects, was to inflict a terrible blow upon the pride of
      that generous nature. Louis was more easily captivated by vanity than
      affection. Madame had wisely calculated her vengeance, and it has been
      seen, also, in what manner she carried it out. Let it not be supposed,
      however, that Madame possessed such terrible passions as the heroines of
      the middle ages, or that she regarded things from a pessimistic point of
      view; on the contrary, Madame, young, amiable, of cultivated intellect,
      coquettish, loving in her nature, but rather from fancy, or imagination,
      or ambition, than from her heart&mdash;Madame, we say, on the contrary,
      inaugurated that epoch of light and fleeting amusements, which
      distinguished the hundred and twenty years that intervened between the
      middle of the seventeenth century, and the last quarter of the eighteenth.
      Madame saw, therefore, or rather fancied she saw, things under their true
      aspect; she knew that the king, her august brother-in-law, had been the
      first to ridicule the humble La Valliere, and that, in accordance with his
      usual custom, it was hardly probable he would ever love the person who had
      excited his laughter, even had it been only for a moment. Moreover, was
      not her vanity ever present, that evil influence which plays so important
      a part in that comedy of dramatic incidents called the life of a woman?
      Did not her vanity tell her, aloud, in a subdued voice, in a whisper, in
      every variety of tone, that she could not, in reality, she a princess,
      young, beautiful, and rich, be compared to the poor La Valliere, as
      youthful as herself it is true, but far less pretty, certainly, and
      utterly without money, protectors, or position? And surprise need not be
      excited with respect to Madame; for it is known that the greatest
      characters are those who flatter themselves the most in the comparisons
      they draw between themselves and others, between others and themselves. It
      may perhaps be asked what was Madame's motive for an attack so skillfully
      conceived and executed. Why was there such a display of forces, if it were
      not seriously her intention to dislodge the king from a heart that had
      never been occupied before, in which he seemed disposed to take refuge?
      Was there any necessity, then, for Madame to attach so great an importance
      to La Valliere, if she did not fear her? Yet Madame did not fear La
      Valliere in that direction in which an historian, who knows everything,
      sees into the future, or rather, the past. Madame was neither a prophetess
      nor a sibyl; nor could she, any more than another, read what was written
      in that terrible and fatal book of the future, which records in its most
      secret pages the most serious events. No, Madame desired simply to punish
      the king for having availed himself of secret means altogether feminine in
      their nature; she wished to prove to him that if he made use of offensive
      weapons of that nature, she, a woman of ready wit and high descent, would
      assuredly discover in the arsenal of her imagination defensive weapons
      proof even against the thrusts of a monarch. Moreover, she wished him to
      learn that, in a war of that description, kings are held of no account,
      or, at all events, that kings who fight on their own behalf, like ordinary
      individuals, may witness the fall of their crown in the first encounter;
      and that, in fact, if he had expected to be adored by all the ladies of
      the court from the very first, from a confident reliance on his mere
      appearance, it was a pretension which was most preposterous and insulting
      even, for certain persons who filled a higher position than others, and
      that a lesson taught in season to this royal personage, who assumed too
      high and haughty a carriage, would be rendering him a great service. Such,
      indeed, were Madame's reflections with respect to the king. The sequel
      itself was not thought of. And in this manner, it will be seen that she
      had exercised all her influence over the minds of her maids of honor, and
      with all its accompanying details, had arranged the comedy which had just
      been acted. The king was completely bewildered by it; for the first time
      since he had escaped from the trammels of M. de Mazarin, he found himself
      treated as a man. Similar severity from any of his subjects would have
      been at once resisted by him. Strength comes with battle. But to match
      one's self with women, to be attacked by them, to have been imposed upon
      by mere girls from the country, who had come from Blois expressly for that
      purpose; it was the depth of dishonor for a young sovereign full of the
      pride his personal advantages and royal power inspired him with. There was
      nothing he could do&mdash;neither reproaches, nor exile&mdash;nor could he
      even show the annoyance he felt. To manifest vexation would have been to
      admit that he had been touched, like Hamlet, by a sword from which the
      button had been removed&mdash;the sword of ridicule. To show animosity
      against women&mdash;humiliation! especially when the women in question
      have laughter on their side, as a means of vengeance. If, instead of
      leaving all the responsibility of the affair to these women, one of the
      courtiers had had anything to do with the intrigue, how delightedly would
      Louis have seized the opportunity of turning the Bastile to personal
      account. But there, again, the king's anger paused, checked by reason. To
      be the master of armies, of prisons, of an almost divine authority, and to
      exert such majesty and might in the service of a petty grudge, would be
      unworthy not only of a monarch, but even of a man. It was necessary,
      therefore, simply to swallow the affront in silence, and to wear his usual
      gentleness and graciousness of expression. It was essential to treat
      Madame as a friend. As a friend!&mdash;Well, and why not? Either Madame
      had been the instigator of the affair, or the affair itself had found her
      passive. If she had been the instigator of it, it certainly was a bold
      measure on her part, but, at all events, it was but natural in her. Who
      was it that had sought her in the earliest moments of her married life to
      whisper words of love in her ear? Who was it that had dared to calculate
      the possibility of committing a crime against the marriage vow&mdash;a
      crime, too, still more deplorable on account of the relationship between
      them? Who was it that, shielded behind his royal authority, had said to
      this young creature: be not afraid, love but the king of France, who is
      above all, and a movement of whose sceptered hand will protect you against
      all attacks, even from your own remorse? And she had listened to and
      obeyed the royal voice, had been influenced by his ensnaring tones; and
      when, morally speaking, she had sacrificed her honor in listening to him,
      she saw herself repaid for her sacrifice by an infidelity the more
      humiliating, since it was occasioned by a woman far beneath her in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Madame, therefore, been the instigator of the revenge, she would have
      been right. If, on the contrary, she had remained passive in the whole
      affair, what grounds had the king to be angry with her on that account?
      Was it for her to restrain, or rather could she restrain, the chattering
      of a few country girls? and was it for her, by an excess of zeal that
      might have been misinterpreted, to check, at the risk of increasing it,
      the impertinence of their conduct? All these various reasonings were like
      so many actual stings to the king's pride; but when he had carefully, in
      his own mind, gone over all the various causes of complaint, Louis was
      surprised, upon due reflection&mdash;in other words, after the wound has
      been dressed&mdash;to find that there were other causes of suffering,
      secret, unendurable, and unrevealed. There was one circumstance he dared
      not confess, even to himself; namely, that the acute pain from which he
      was suffering had its seat in his heart. The fact is, he had permitted his
      heart to be gratified by La Valliere's innocent confusion. He had dreamed
      of a pure affection&mdash;of an affection for Louis the man, and not the
      sovereign&mdash;of an affection free from all self-interest; and his
      heart, simpler and more youthful than he had imagined it to be, had to
      meet that other heart that had revealed itself to him by its aspirations.
      The commonest thing in the complicated history of love, is the double
      inoculation of love to which any two hearts are subjected; the one loves
      nearly always before the other, in the same way that the latter finishes
      nearly always by loving after the other. In this way, the electric current
      is established, in proportion to the intensity of the passion which is
      first kindled. The more Mademoiselle de la Valliere showed her affection,
      the more the king's affection had increased. And it was precisely that
      which had annoyed his majesty. For it was now fairly demonstrated to him,
      that no sympathetic current had been the means of hurrying his heart away
      in its course, because there had been no confession of love in the case&mdash;because
      the confession was, in fact, an insult towards the man and towards the
      sovereign; and finally, because&mdash;and the word, too, burnt like a hot
      iron&mdash;because, in fact, it was nothing but a mystification after all.
      This girl, therefore, who, in strictness, could not lay claim to beauty,
      or birth, or great intelligence&mdash;who had been selected by Madame
      herself, on account of her unpretending position, had not only aroused the
      king's regard, but had, moreover, treated him with disdain&mdash;he, the
      king, a man who, like an eastern potentate, had but to bestow a glance, to
      indicate with his finger, to throw his handkerchief. And, since the
      previous evening, his mind had been so absorbed with this girl that he
      could think and dream of nothing else. Since the previous evening his
      imagination had been occupied by clothing her image with charms to which
      she could not lay claim. In very truth, he whom such vast interests
      summoned, and whom so many women smiled upon invitingly, had, since the
      previous evening, consecrated every moment of his time, every throb of his
      heart, to this sole dream. It was, indeed, either too much, or not
      sufficient. The indignation of the king, making him forget everything,
      and, among others, that Saint-Aignan was present, was poured out in the
      most violent imprecations. True it is, that Saint-Aignan had taken refuge
      in a corner of the room; and from his corner, regarded the tempest passing
      over. His own personal disappointment seemed contemptible, in comparison
      with the anger of the king. He compared with his own petty vanity the
      prodigious pride of offended majesty; and, being well read in the hearts
      of kings in general, and in those of powerful kings in particular, he
      began to ask himself if this weight of anger, as yet held in suspense,
      would not soon terminate by falling upon his own head, for the very reason
      that others were guilty, and he innocent. In point of fact, the king, all
      at once, did arrest his hurried pace; and, fixing a look full of anger
      upon Saint-Aignan, suddenly cried out: "And you, Saint-Aignan?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan made a sign which was intended to signify, "Well, sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; you have been as silly as myself, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire," stammered out Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You permitted us to be deceived by this shameless trick."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire," said Saint-Aignan, whose agitation was such as to make him tremble
      in every limb, "let me entreat your majesty not to exasperate yourself.
      Women, you know, are characters full of imperfections, created for the
      misfortune of mankind: to expect anything good from them is to require
      them to perform impossibilities."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, who had the greatest consideration for himself, and who had
      begun to acquire over his emotions that command which he preserved over
      them all his life, perceived that he was doing an outrage to his own
      dignity in displaying so much animosity about so trifling an object. "No,"
      he said, hastily; "you are mistaken, Saint-Aignan; I am not angry; I can
      only wonder that we should have been turned into ridicule so cleverly and
      with such audacity by these young girls. I am particularly surprised that,
      although we might have informed ourselves accurately on the subject, we
      were silly enough to leave the matter for our own hearts to decide."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The heart, sire, is an organ which requires positively to be reduced to
      its material functions, but which, for the sake of humanity's peace of
      mind, should be deprived of all its metaphysical inclinations. For my own
      part, I confess, when I saw that your majesty's heart was so taken up by
      this little&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My heart taken up! I! My mind might, perhaps, have been so; but as for my
      heart, it was&mdash;" Louis again perceived that, in order to fill one
      gulf, he was about to dig another. "Besides," he added, "I have no fault
      to find with the girl. I was quite aware that she was in love with some
      one else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Vicomte de Bragelonne. I informed your majesty of the circumstance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did so: but you were not the first who told me. The Comte de la Fere
      had solicited from me Mademoiselle de la Valliere's hand for his son. And,
      on his return from England, the marriage shall be celebrated, since they
      love each other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I recognize your majesty's great generosity of disposition in that act."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, Saint-Aignan, we will cease to occupy ourselves with these matters
      any longer," said Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we will digest the affront, sire," replied the courtier, with
      resignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides, it will be an easy matter to do so," said the king, checking a
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And, by way of a beginning, I will set about the composition of an
      epigram upon all three of them. I will call it 'The Naiad and Dryad,'
      which will please Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so, Saint-Aignan, do so," said the king, indifferently. "You shall
      read me your verses; they will amuse me. Ah! it does not signify,
      Saint-Aignan," added the king, like a man breathing with difficulty, "the
      blow requires more than human strength to support in a dignified manner."
      As the king thus spoke, assuming an air of the most angelic patience, one
      of the servants in attendance knocked gently at the door. Saint-Aignan
      drew aside, out of respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in," said the king. The servant partially opened the door. "What is
      it?" inquired Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant held out a letter of a triangular shape. "For your majesty,"
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From whom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know. One of the officers on duty gave it to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The valet, in obedience to a gesture of the king, handed him the letter.
      The king advanced towards the candles, opened the note, read the
      signature, and uttered a loud cry. Saint-Aignan was sufficiently
      respectful not to look on; but, without looking on, he saw and heard all,
      and ran towards the king, who with a gesture dismissed the servant. "Oh,
      heavens!" said the king, as he read the note.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is your majesty unwell?" inquired Saint-Aignan, stretching forward his
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, Saint-Aignan&mdash;read!" and he handed him the note.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan's eyes fell upon the signature. "La Valliere!" he exclaimed.
      "Oh, sire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read, <i>read!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Saint-Aignan read:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive my importunity, sire; and forgive, also, the absence of the
      formalities which may be wanting in this letter. A note seems to be more
      speedy and more urgent than a dispatch. I venture, therefore, to address
      this note to your majesty. I have retired to my own room, overcome with
      grief and fatigue, sire; and I implore your majesty to grant me the favor
      of an audience, which will enable me to confess the <i>truth</i> to my
      sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      "LOUISE de la VALLIERE."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" asked the king, taking the letter from Saint-Aignan's hands, who
      was completely bewildered by what he had just read.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" repeated Saint-Aignan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hardly know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, what is your opinion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, the young lady must have heard the muttering of the thunder, and
      has got frightened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Frightened at what?" asked Louis with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, your majesty has a thousand reasons to be angry with the author or
      authors of so hazardous a joke; and, if your majesty's memory were to be
      awakened in a disagreeable sense, it would be a perpetual menace hanging
      over the head of this imprudent girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saint-Aignan, I do not think as you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty doubtless sees more clearly than myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! I see affliction and restraint in these lines; more particularly
      since I recall some of the details of the scene which took place this
      evening in Madame's apartments&mdash;" The king suddenly stopped, leaving
      his meaning unexpressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In fact," resumed Saint-Aignan, "your majesty will grant an audience;
      nothing is clearer than that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do better, Saint-Aignan."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is that, sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put on your cloak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, sire&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know the suite of rooms where Madame's maids of honor are lodged?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know some means of obtaining an entrance there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As far as that is concerned, I do not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events, you must be acquainted with some one there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, your majesty is the source of every good idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do know some one, then. Who is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know a certain gentleman, who is on very good terms with a certain
      young lady there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of the maids of honor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente, I suppose?" said the king,
      laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fortunately, no, sire; with Montalais."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Malicorne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you can depend on him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe so, sire. He ought to have a key of some sort in his
      possession; and if he should happen to have one, as I have done him a
      service, why, he will let us have it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing could be better. Let us set off immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king threw his cloak over Saint-Aignan's shoulders, asked him for his,
      and both went out into the vestibule.

    <h2>
      Chapter LIX. Something That neither Naiad nor Dryad Foresaw.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan stopped at the foot of the staircase leading to the <i>entresol</i>,
      where the maids of honor were lodged, and to the first floor, where
      Madame's apartments were situated. Then, by means of one of the servants
      who was passing, he sent to apprise Malicorne, who was still with
      Monsieur. After having waited ten minutes, Malicorne arrived, full of
      self-importance. The king drew back towards the darkest part of the
      vestibule. Saint-Aignan, on the contrary, advanced to meet him, but at the
      first words, indicating his wish, Malicorne drew back abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, oh!" he said, "you want me to introduce you into the rooms of the
      maids of honor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know very well that I cannot do anything of the kind, without being
      made acquainted with your object."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unfortunately, my dear Monsieur Malicorne, it is quite impossible for me
      to give you any explanation; you must therefore confide in me as in a
      friend who got you out of a great difficulty yesterday, and who now begs
      you to draw him out of one to-day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet I told you, monsieur, what my object was; which was, not to sleep out
      in the open air, and any man might express the same wish, whilst you,
      however, admit nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe me, my dear Monsieur Malicorne," Saint-Aignan persisted, "that if
      I were permitted to explain myself, I would do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, my dear monsieur, it is impossible for me to allow you to
      enter Mademoiselle de Montalais's apartment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know why, better than any one else, since you caught me on the wall
      paying my addresses to Mademoiselle de Montalais; it would, therefore, be
      an excess of kindness on my part, you will admit, since I am paying my
      attentions to her, to open the door of her room to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who told you it was on her account I asked you for the key?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For whom, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She does not lodge there alone, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, certainly; for Mademoiselle de la Valliere shares her rooms with her;
      but, really, you have nothing more to do with Mademoiselle de la Valliere
      than with Mademoiselle de Montalais, and there are only two men to whom I
      would give this key; to M. de Bragelonne, if he begged me to give it to
      him, and to the king, if he commanded me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, give me the key, monsieur: I order you to do so," said the
      king, advancing from the obscurity, and partially opening his cloak.
      "Mademoiselle de Montalais will step down to talk with you, while we go
      up-stairs to Mademoiselle de la Valliere, for, in fact, it is she only
      whom we desire to see."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king!" exclaimed Malicorne, bowing to the very ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, the king," said Louis, smiling: "the king, who is as pleased with
      your resistance as with your capitulation. Rise, monsieur, and render us
      the service we request of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I obey, your majesty," said Malicorne, leading the way up the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get Mademoiselle de Montalais to come down," said the king, "and do not
      breathe a word to her of my visit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Malicorne bowed in token of obedience, and proceeded up the staircase. But
      the king, after a hasty reflection, followed him, and that, too, with such
      rapidity, that, although Malicorne was already more than half-way up the
      staircase, the king reached the room at the same moment. He then observed,
      by the door which remained half-opened behind Malicorne, La Valliere,
      sitting in an armchair with her head thrown back, and in the opposite
      corner Montalais, who, in her dressing-gown, was standing before a
      looking-glass, engaged in arranging her hair, and parleying the while with
      Malicorne. The king hurriedly opened the door and entered the room.
      Montalais called out at the noise made by the opening of the door, and,
      recognizing the king, made her escape. La Valliere rose from her seat,
      like a dead person galvanized, and then fell back in her armchair. The
      king advanced slowly towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wished for an audience, I believe," he said coldly. "I am ready to
      hear you. Speak."
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan, faithful to his character of being deaf, blind, and dumb,
      had stationed himself in a corner of the door, upon a stool which by
      chance he found there. Concealed by the tapestry which covered the
      doorway, and leaning his back against the wall, he could thus listen
      without being seen; resigning himself to the post of a good watch-dog, who
      patiently waits and watches without ever getting in his master's way.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere, terror-stricken at the king's irritated aspect, rose a second
      time, and assuming a posture full of humility and entreaty, murmured,
      "Forgive me, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What need is there for my forgiveness?" asked Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, I have been guilty of a great fault; nay, more than a great fault,
      a great crime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, I have offended your majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in the slightest degree in the world," replied Louis XIV.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I implore you, sire, not to maintain towards me that terrible seriousness
      of manner which reveals your majesty's just anger. I feel I have offended
      you, sire; but I wish to explain to you how it was that I have not
      offended you of my own accord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place," said the king, "in what way can you possibly have
      offended me? I cannot perceive how. Surely not on account of a young
      girl's harmless and very innocent jest? You turned the credulity of a
      young man into ridicule&mdash;it was very natural to do so: any other
      woman in your place would have done the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! your majesty overwhelms me by your remark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, if I had been the author of the jest, it would not have been
      innocent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, is that all you had to say to me in soliciting an audience?" said
      the king, as though about to turn away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon La Valliere, in an abrupt and a broken voice, her eyes dried up
      by the fire of her tears, made a step towards the king, and said, "Did
      your majesty hear everything?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything I said beneath the royal oak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not lose a syllable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, after your majesty really heard all, are you able to think I
      abused your credibility?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Credulity; yes, indeed, you have selected the very word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And your majesty did not suppose that a poor girl like myself might
      possibly be compelled to submit to the will of others?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me," returned the king; "but I shall never be able to understand
      that she, who of her own free will could express herself so unreservedly
      beneath the royal oak, would allow herself to be influenced to such an
      extent by the direction of others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the threat held out against me, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Threat! who threatened you&mdash;who dared to threaten you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those who have the right to do so, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not recognize any one as possessing the right to threaten the
      humblest of my subjects."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, sire, but near your majesty, even, there are persons
      sufficiently high in position to have, or to believe that they possess,
      the right of injuring a young girl, without fortune, and possessing only
      her reputation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way injure her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In depriving her of her reputation, by disgracefully expelling her from
      the court."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Mademoiselle de la Valliere," said the king bitterly, "I prefer those
      persons who exculpate themselves without incriminating others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; and I confess that I greatly regret to perceive, that an easy
      justification, as your own would have been, is now complicated in my
      presence by a tissue of reproaches and imputations against others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And which you do not believe?" exclaimed La Valliere. The king remained
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, but tell me!" repeated La Valliere, vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I regret to confess it," repeated the king, bowing coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl uttered a deep groan, striking her hands together in
      despair. "You do not believe me, then," she said to the king, who still
      remained silent, while poor La Valliere's features became visibly changed
      at his continued silence. "Therefore, you believe," she said, "that I
      pre-arranged this ridiculous, this infamous plot, of trifling, in so
      shameless a manner, with your majesty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay," said the king, "it was neither ridiculous nor infamous; it was not
      even a plot; merely a jest, more or less amusing, and nothing more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" murmured the young girl, "the king does not, and will not believe
      me, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, indeed, I will not believe you," said the king. "Besides, in point of
      fact, what can be more natural? The king, you argue, follows me, listens
      to me, watches me; the king wishes perhaps to amuse himself at my expense,
      I will amuse myself at his, and as the king is very tender-hearted, I will
      take his heart by storm."
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere hid her face in her hands, as she stifled her sobs. The king
      continued pitilessly; he was revenging himself upon the poor victim before
      him for all he had himself suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us invent, then, this story of my loving him and preferring him to
      others. The king is so simple and so conceited that he will believe me;
      and then we can go and tell others how credulous the king is, and can
      enjoy a laugh at his expense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" exclaimed La Valliere, "you think that, you believe that!&mdash;it
      is frightful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And," pursued the king, "that is not all; if this self-conceited prince
      take our jest seriously, if he should be imprudent enough to exhibit
      before others anything like delight at it, well, in that case, the king
      will be humiliated before the whole court; and what a delightful story it
      will be, too, for him to whom I am really attached, in fact part of my
      dowry for my husband, to have the adventure to relate of the monarch who
      was so amusingly deceived by a young girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire!" exclaimed La Valliere, her mind bewildered, almost wandering,
      indeed, "not another word, I implore you; do you not see that you are
      killing me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A jest, nothing but a jest," murmured the king, who, however, began to be
      somewhat affected.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere fell upon her knees, and that so violently, that the sound
      could be heard upon the hard floor. "Sire," she said, "I prefer shame to
      disloyalty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?" inquired the king, without moving a step to raise the
      young girl from her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, when I shall have sacrificed my honor and my reason both to you,
      you will perhaps believe in my loyalty. The tale which was related to you
      in Madame's apartments, and by Madame herself, is utterly false; and that
      which I said beneath the great oak&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the only truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" exclaimed the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire," exclaimed La Valliere, hurried away by the violence of her
      emotions, "were I to die of shame on the very spot where my knees are
      fixed, I would repeat it until my latest breath; I said that I loved you,
      and it is true; I do love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have loved you, sire, from the very first day I ever saw you; from the
      moment when at Blois, where I was pining away my existence, your royal
      looks, full of light and life, were first bent upon me. I love you still,
      sire; it is a crime of high treason, I know, that a poor girl like myself
      should love her sovereign, and should presume to tell him so. Punish me
      for my audacity, despise me for my shameless immodesty; but do not ever
      say, do not ever think, that I have jested with or deceived you. I belong
      to a family whose loyalty has been proved, sire, and I, too, love my
      king."
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly her strength, voice, and respiration ceased, and she fell
      forward, like the flower Virgil alludes to, which the scythe of the reaper
      severed in the midst of the grass. The king, at these words, at this
      vehement entreaty, no longer retained any ill-will or doubt in his mind:
      his whole heart seemed to expand at the glowing breath of an affection
      which proclaimed itself in such noble and courageous language. When,
      therefore, he heard the passionate confession, his strength seemed to fail
      him, and he hid his face in his hands. But when he felt La Valliere's
      hands clinging to his own, when their warm pressure fired his blood, he
      bent forward, and passing his arm round La Valliere's waist, he raised her
      from the ground and pressed her against his heart. But she, her drooping
      head fallen forward on her bosom, seemed to have ceased to live. The king,
      terrified, called out for Saint-Aignan. Saint-Aignan, who had carried his
      discretion so far as to remain without stirring in his corner, pretending
      to wipe away a tear, ran forward at the king's summons. He then assisted
      Louis to seat the young girl upon a couch, slapped her hands, sprinkled
      some Hungary water over her face, calling out all the while, "Come, come,
      it is all over; the king believes you, and forgives you. There, there now!
      take care, or you will agitate his majesty too much; his majesty is so
      sensitive, so tender-hearted. Now, really, Mademoiselle de la Valliere,
      you must pay attention, for the king is very pale."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was, the king was visibly losing color. But La Valliere did not
      move.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do pray recover," continued Saint-Aignan. "I beg, I implore you; it is
      really time you should; think only of one thing, that if the king should
      become unwell, I should be obliged to summon his physician. What a state
      of things that would be! So do pray rouse yourself; make an effort, pray
      do, and do so at once, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was difficult to display more persuasive eloquence than Saint-Aignan
      did, but something still more powerful, and of a more energetic nature
      than this eloquence, aroused La Valliere. The king, who was kneeling
      before her, covered the palms of her hands with those burning kisses which
      are to the hands what a kiss upon the lips is to the face. La Valliere's
      senses returned to her; she languidly opened her eyes and, with a dying
      look, murmured, "Oh! sire, has your majesty pardoned me, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The king did not reply, for he was still too much overcome. Saint-Aignan
      thought it was his duty again to retire, for he observed the passionate
      devotion which was displayed in the king's gaze. La Valliere rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, sire, that I have justified myself, at least I trust so, in your
      majesty's eyes, grant me leave to retire into a convent. I shall bless
      your majesty all my life, and I shall die thanking and loving Heaven for
      having granted me one hour of perfect happiness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," replied the king, "you will live here blessing Heaven, on the
      contrary, but loving Louis, who will make your existence one of perfect
      felicity&mdash;Louis who loves you&mdash;Louis who swears it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! sire, sire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And upon this doubt of La Valliere, the king's kisses became so warm that
      Saint-Aignan thought it was his duty to retire behind the tapestry. These
      kisses, however, which she had not the strength at first to resist, began
      to intimidate the young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! sire," she exclaimed, "do not make me repeat my loyalty, for this
      would show me that your majesty despises me still."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle de la Valliere," said the king, suddenly, drawing back with
      an air full of respect, "there is nothing in the world that I love and
      honor more than yourself, and nothing in my court, I call Heaven to
      witness, shall be so highly regarded as you shall be henceforward. I
      entreat your forgiveness for my transport; it arose from an excess of
      affection, but I can prove to you that I love you more than ever by
      respecting you as much as you can possibly desire or deserve." Then,
      bending before her, and taking her by the hand, he said to her, "Will you
      honor me by accepting the kiss I press upon your hand?" And the king's
      lips were pressed respectfully and lightly upon the young girl's trembling
      hand. "Henceforth," added Louis, rising and bending his glance upon La
      Valliere, "henceforth you are under my safeguard. Do not speak to any one
      of the injury I have done you, forgive others that which they may have
      attempted. For the future, you shall be so far above all those, that, far
      from inspiring you with fear, they shall be even beneath your pity." And
      he bowed as reverently as though he were leaving a place of worship. Then
      calling to Saint-Aignan, who approached with great humility, he said, "I
      hope, comte, that Mademoiselle de la Valliere will kindly confer a little
      of her friendship upon you, in return for that which I have vowed to her
      eternally."
    </p>
    <p>
      Saint-Aignan bent his knee before La Valliere, saying, "How happy, indeed,
      would such an honor make me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will send your companion back to you," said the king. "Farewell! or,
      rather, adieu till we meet again; do not forget me in your prayers, I
      entreat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" cried La Valliere, "be assured that you and Heaven are in my heart
      together."
    </p>
    <p>
      These words of Louise elated the king, who, full of happiness, hurried
      Saint-Aignan down the stairs. Madame had not anticipated this <i>denouement</i>;
      and neither the Naiad nor the Dryad had breathed a word about it.

    <h2>
      Chapter LX. The New General of the Jesuits.
    </h2>
    <p>
      While La Valliere and the king were mingling, in their first confession of
      love, all the bitterness of the past, the happiness of the present, and
      hopes of the future, Fouquet had retired to the apartments which had been
      assigned to him in the chateau, and was conversing with Aramis precisely
      upon the very subjects which the king at that moment was forgetting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now tell me," said Fouquet, after having installed his guest in an
      armchair and seated himself by his side, "tell me, Monsieur d'Herblay,
      what is our position with regard to the Belle-Isle affair, and whether you
      have received any news about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything is going on in that direction as we wish," replied Aramis;
      "the expenses have been paid, and nothing has transpired of our designs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what about the soldiers the king wished to send there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have received news this morning they arrived there fifteen days ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And how have they been treated?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the best manner possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has become of the former garrison?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The soldiers were landed at Sarzeau, and then transferred immediately to
      Quimper."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the new garrison?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Belongs to us from this very moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you sure of what you say, my dear Monsieur de Vannes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite sure, and, moreover, you will see by and by how matters have turned
      out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still you are very well aware, that, of all the garrison towns,
      Belle-Isle is precisely the very worst."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know it, and have acted accordingly; no space to move about, no gayety,
      no cheerful society, no gambling permitted: well, it is a great pity,"
      added Aramis, with one of those smiles so peculiar to him, "to see how
      much young people at the present day seek amusement, and how much,
      consequently, they incline to the man who procures and pays for their
      favorite pastimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if they amuse themselves at Bell-Isle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If they amuse themselves through the king's means, they will attach
      themselves to the king; but if they get bored to death through the king's
      means, and amuse themselves through M. Fouquet, they will attach
      themselves to M. Fouquet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you informed my intendant, of course?&mdash;so that immediately on
      their arrival&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By no means; they were left alone a whole week, to weary themselves at
      their ease; but, at the end of the week, they cried out, saying that
      former officers amused themselves much better. Whereupon they were told
      that the old officers had been able to make a friend of M. Fouquet, and
      that M. Fouquet, knowing them to be friends of his, had from that moment
      done all he possibly could to prevent their getting wearied or bored upon
      his estates. Upon this they began to reflect. Immediately afterwards,
      however, the intendant added, that without anticipating M. Fouquet's
      orders, he knew his master sufficiently well to be aware that he took an
      interest in every gentleman in the king's service, and that, although he
      did not know the new-comers, he would do as much for them as he had done
      for the others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellent! and I trust that the promises were followed up; I desire, as
      you know, that no promise should ever be made in my name without being
      kept."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without a moment's loss of time, our two privateers, and your own horses,
      were placed at the disposal of the officers; the keys of the principal
      mansion were handed over to them, so that they made up hunting-parties,
      and walking excursions with such ladies as are to be found in Belle-Isle;
      and such other as they are enabled to enlist from the neighborhood, who
      have no fear of sea-sickness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there is a fair sprinkling to be met with at Sarzeau and Vannes, I
      believe, your eminence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; in fact all along the coast," said Aramis, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And now, how about the soldiers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything precisely the same, in a relative degree, you understand; the
      soldiers have plenty of wine, excellent provisions, and good pay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good; so that&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that this garrison can be depended upon, and it is a better one than
      the last."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The result is, if Fortune favors us, so that the garrisons are changed in
      this manner, only every two months, that, at the end of every three years,
      the whole army will, in its turn, have been there; and, therefore, instead
      of having one regiment in our favor, we shall have fifty thousand men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes; I knew perfectly well," said Fouquet, "that no friend could be
      more incomparable and invaluable than yourself, my dear Monsieur
      d'Herblay; but," he added, laughing, "all this time we are forgetting our
      friend, Du Vallon; what has become of him? During the three days I spent
      at Saint-Mande, I confess I have forgotten him completely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not forget him, however," returned Aramis. "Porthos is at
      Saint-Mande; his joints are kept well greased, the greatest care is being
      taken care of him with regard to the food he eats, and the wines he
      drinks; I advise him to take daily airings in the small park, which you
      have kept for your own use, and he makes us of it accordingly. He begins
      to walk again, he exercises his muscular powers by bending down young
      elm-trees, or making the old oaks fly into splinters, as Milo of Crotona
      used to do; and, as there are no lions in the park, it is not unlikely we
      shall find him alive. Porthos is a brave fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but in the mean time he will get bored to death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no; he never does that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will be asking questions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He sees no one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events, he is looking or hoping for something or another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have inspired in him a hope which we will realize some fine morning,
      and on that he subsists."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That of being presented to the king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! in what character?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As the engineer of Belle-Isle, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we not be obliged, then, to send him back to Belle-Isle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most certainly; I am even thinking of sending him as soon as possible.
      Porthos is very fond of display; he is man whose weakness D'Artagnan,
      Athos, and myself are alone acquainted with; he never commits himself in
      any way; he is dignity himself; to the officers there, he would seem like
      a Paladin of the time of the Crusades. He would make the whole staff
      drunk, without getting tipsy in the least himself, and every one will
      regard him with admiration and sympathy; if, therefore, it should happen
      that we have any orders requiring to be carried out, Porthos is an
      incarnation of the order itself, and whatever he chose to do others would
      find themselves obliged to submit to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Send him back, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is what I intend to do; but only in a few days; for I must not omit
      to tell you one thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I begin to mistrust D'Artagnan. He is not at Fontainebleau, as you may
      have noticed, and D'Artagnan is never absent, or apparently idle, without
      some object in view. And now that my own affairs are settled, I am going
      to try and ascertain what the affairs are in which D'Artagnan is engaged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your own affairs are settled, you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very fortunate in that case, then, and I should like to be able
      to say the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope you do not make yourself uneasy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hum!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing could be better than the king's reception of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Colbert leaves you in peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case," said Aramis, with that connection of ideas which marked
      him, "in that case, then, we can bestow a thought upon the young girl I
      was speaking to you about yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, have you forgotten already? I mean La Valliere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! of course, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you object, then, to try and make a conquest of her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In one respect only; my heart is engaged in another direction, and I
      positively do not care about the girl in the least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, oh!" said Aramis, "your heart is engaged, you say. The deuce! we must
      take care of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because it is terrible to have the heart occupied, when others, besides
      yourself, have so much need of the head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right. So you see, at your first summons, I left everything. But
      to return to this girl. What good do you see in my troubling myself about
      her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This.&mdash;The king, it is said, has taken a fancy to her; at least, so
      it is supposed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you, who know everything, know very differently."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know that the king is greatly and suddenly changed; that the day before
      yesterday he was crazy over Madame; that a few days ago, Monsieur
      complained of it, even to the queen-mother; and that some conjugal
      misunderstandings and maternal scoldings were the consequence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know all that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do know it; at all events, since these misunderstandings and scoldings,
      the king has not addressed a word, has not paid the slightest attention,
      to her royal highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what next?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since then, he has been taken up with Mademoiselle de la Valliere. Now,
      Mademoiselle de la Valliere is one of Madame's maids of honor. You happen
      to know, I suppose, what is called a <i>chaperon</i> in matters of love.
      Well, then, Mademoiselle de la Valliere is Madame's <i>chaperon</i>. It is
      for you to take advantage of this state of things. You have no occasion
      for me to tell you that. But, at all events, wounded vanity will render
      the conquest an easier one; the girl will get hold of the king, and
      Madame's secret, and you can scarcely predict what a man of intelligence
      can do with a secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how to get at her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, you, of all men, to ask me such a question!" said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very true. I shall not have any time to take any notice of her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is poor and unassuming, you will create a position for her, and
      whether she tames the king as his lady confessor, or his sweetheart, you
      will have enlisted a new and valuable ally."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good," said Fouquet. "What is to be done, then, with regard to this
      girl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whenever you have taken a fancy to any lady, Monsieur Fouquet, what
      course have you generally pursued?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have written to her, protesting my devotion to her. I have added, how
      happy I should be to render her any service in my power, and have signed
      'Fouquet,' at the end of the letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And has any one offered resistance?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One person only," replied Fouquet. "But, four days ago, she yielded, as
      the others had done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you take the trouble to write?" said Aramis, holding a pen towards
      him, which Fouquet took, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will write at your dictation. My head is so taken up in another
      direction, that I should not be able to write a couple lines."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said Aramis, "write."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he dictated, as follows: "Mademoiselle&mdash;I have seen you&mdash;and
      you will not be surprised to learn, I think you very beautiful. But, for
      want of the position you merit at court, your presence there is a waste of
      time. The devotion of a man of honor, should ambition of any kind inspire
      you, might possibly serve as a means of display for your talent and
      beauty. I place my devotion at your feet; but, as an affection, however
      reserved and unpresuming it may be, might possibly compromise the object
      of its worship, it would ill become a person of your merit running the
      risk of being compromised, without her future being assured. If you would
      deign to accept, and reply to my affection, my affection shall prove its
      gratitude to you in making you free and independent forever."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having finished writing, Fouquet looked at Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sign it," said the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it absolutely necessary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your signature at the foot of that letter is worth a million; you forget
      that." Fouquet signed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, by whom do you intend to send this letter?" asked Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By an excellent servant of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you rely on him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a man who has been with me all my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. Besides, in this case, we are not playing for very heavy
      stakes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so? For if what you say be true of the accommodating disposition of
      this girl for the king and Madame, the king will give her all the money
      she can ask for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king has money, then?" asked Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose so, for he has not asked me for any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be easy, he will ask for some, soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, more than that, I had thought he would have spoken to me about the
      <i>fete</i> at Vaux, but he never said a word about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He will be sure to do so, though."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must think the king's disposition a very cruel one, Monsieur
      d'Herblay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not he who is so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is young, and therefore his disposition is a kind one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is young, and either he is weak, or his passions are strong; and
      Monsieur Colbert holds his weakness and his passions in his villainous
      grasp."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You admit that you fear him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not deny it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I that case I am lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My only influence with the king has been through the money I commanded,
      and now I am a ruined man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by 'not so?' Do you know my affairs better than myself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not unlikely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he were to request this <i>fete</i> to be given?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would give it, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where is the money to come from?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever been in want of any?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! if you only knew at what a cost I procured the last supply."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next shall cost you nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But who will give it me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, give me six millions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten, if necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word, D'Herblay," said Fouquet, "your confidence alarms me more
      than the king's displeasure. Who can you possibly be, after all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know me well enough, I should think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course; but what is it you are aiming at?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to see upon the throne of France a king devoted to Monsieur
      Fouquet, and I wish Monsieur Fouquet to be devoted to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" exclaimed Fouquet, pressing his hand,&mdash;"as for being devoted to
      you, I am yours, entirely; but believe me, my dear D'Herblay, you are
      deceiving yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what respect?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king will never become devoted to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not remember to have said that King Louis would ever become devoted
      to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, on the contrary, you have this moment said so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not say <i>the</i> king; I said <i>a</i> king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it not all the same?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, on the contrary, it is altogether different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not understand you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will do so, shortly, then; suppose, for instance, the king in
      question were to be a very different person to Louis XIV."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another person."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, who is indebted for everything to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His very throne, even."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are mad, D'Herblay. There is no man living besides Louis XIV. who can
      sit on the throne of France. I know of none, not one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>But</i> I know one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless it be Monsieur," said Fouquet, looking at Aramis uneasily; "yet
      Monsieur&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is <i>not</i> Monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how can it be, that a prince not of the royal line, that a prince
      without any right&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My king, or rather your king, will be everything that is necessary, be
      assured of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be careful, Monsieur d'Herblay, you make my blood run cold, and my head
      swim."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis smiled. "There is but little occasion for that," he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Again, I repeat, you terrify me," said Fouquet. Aramis smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You laugh," said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The day will come when you will laugh too; only at the present moment I
      must laugh alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But explain yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the proper time comes, I will explain all. Fear nothing. Have faith
      in me, and doubt nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact is, I cannot but doubt, because I do not see clearly, or even at
      all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is because of your blindness; but a day will come when you will be
      enlightened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Fouquet, "how willingly would I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, without belief! you, who, through my means, have ten times crossed
      the abyss yawning at your feet, and in which, had you been alone, you
      would have been irretrievably swallowed; you, without belief; you, who
      from procureur-general attained the rank of intendant, from the rank of
      intendant, that of the first minister of the crown, and who from the rank
      of first minister will pass to that of mayor of the palace. But no," he
      said, with the same unaltered smile, "no, no, you cannot see, and
      consequently cannot believe&mdash;what I tell you." And Aramis rose to
      withdraw.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One word more," said Fouquet; "you have never yet spoken to me in this
      manner, you have never yet shown yourself so confident, I should rather
      say so daring."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because it is necessary, in order to speak confidently, to have the lips
      unfettered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that is now your case?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since a very short time, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since yesterday, only."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Monsieur d'Herblay, take care, your confidence is becoming audacity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One can well be audacious when one is powerful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are powerful?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have already offered you ten millions; I repeat the offer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet rose, profoundly agitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come," he said, "come; you spoke of overthrowing kings and replacing them
      by others. If, indeed, I am not really out of my senses, is or is not that
      what you said just now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are by no means out of your senses, for it is perfectly true I did
      say all that just now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why did you say so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because it is easy to speak in this manner of thrones being cast down,
      and kings being raised up, when one is, one's self, far above all kings
      and thrones, of this world at least."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your power is infinite, then?" cried Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have told you so already, and I repeat it," replied Aramis, with
      glistening eyes and trembling lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet threw himself back in his chair, and buried his face in his hands.
      Aramis looked at him for a moment, as the angel of human destinies might
      have looked upon a simple mortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adieu," he said to him, "sleep undisturbed, and send your letter to La
      Valliere. To-morrow we shall see each other again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, to-morrow," said Fouquet, shaking his hands like a man returning to
      his senses. "But where shall we see each other?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the king's promenade, if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Agreed." And they separated.

    <h2>
      Chapter LXI. The Storm.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dawn of the following day was dark and gloomy, and as every one knew
      that the promenade was down in the royal programme, every one's gaze, as
      his eyes were opened, was directed towards the sky. Just above the tops of
      the trees a thick, suffocating vapor seemed to remain suspended, with
      barely sufficient power to rise thirty feet above the ground under the
      influence of the sun's rays, which was scarcely visible as a faint spot of
      lesser darkness through the veil of heavy mist. No dew had fallen in the
      morning; the turf was dried up for want of moisture, the flowers withered.
      The birds sang less inspiringly than usual upon the boughs, which remained
      motionless as the limbs of corpses. The strange confused and animated
      murmurs, which seemed born and to exist in virtue of the sun, that
      respiration of nature which is unceasingly heard amidst all other sounds,
      could not be heard now, and never had the silence been so profound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king had noticed the cheerless aspect of the heavens as he approached
      the window immediately upon rising. But as all the necessary directions
      had been given respecting the promenade, and every preparation had been
      made accordingly, and as, which was far more imperious than anything else,
      Louis relied upon this promenade to satisfy the cravings of his
      imagination, and we will even already say, the clamorous desires of his
      heart&mdash;the king unhesitatingly decided that the appearance of the
      heavens had nothing whatever to do with the matter; that the promenade was
      arranged, and that, whatever the state of the weather, the promenade
      should take place. Besides, there are certain terrestrial sovereigns who
      seem to have accorded them privileged existences, and there are certain
      times when it might almost be supposed that the expressed wish of an
      earthly monarch has its influence over the Divine will. It was Virgil who
      observed of Augustus: <i>Nocte pluit tota redeunt spectacula mane</i>. <a
      href="#linknote-10" name="linknoteref-10" id="linknoteref-10"><small>10</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis attended mass as usual, but it was evident that his attention was
      somewhat distracted from the presence of the Creator by the remembrance of
      the creature. His mind was occupied during the service in reckoning more
      than once the number of minutes, then of seconds, which separated him from
      the blissful moment when the promenade would begin, that is to say, the
      moment when Madame would set out with her maids of honor. Besides, as a
      matter of course, everybody at the chateau was ignorant of the interview
      which had taken place between La Valliere and the king. Montalais,
      perhaps, with her usual chattering propensity, might have been disposed to
      talk about it; but Montalais on this occasion was held in check by
      Malicorne, who had securely fastened on her pretty lips the golden padlock
      of mutual interest. As for Louis XIV., his happiness was so extreme that
      he had forgiven Madame, or nearly so, her little piece of malice of the
      previous evening. In fact, he had occasion to congratulate himself rather
      than to complain of it. Had it not been for her ill-natured action, he
      would not have received the letter from La Valliere; had it not been for
      the letter, he would have had no interview; and had it not been for the
      interview he would have remained undecided. His heart was filled with too
      much happiness for any ill-feeling to remain in it, at that moment at
      least. Instead, therefore, of knitting his brows into a frown when he
      perceived his sister-in-law, Louis resolved to receive her in a more
      friendly and gracious manner than usual. But on one condition only, that
      she would be ready to set out early. Such was the nature of Louis's
      thoughts during mass; which made him, during the ceremony, forget matters
      which, in his character of Most Christian King and of the eldest son of
      the Church, ought to have occupied his attention. He returned to the
      chateau, and as the promenade was fixed for midday, and it was at present
      just ten o'clock, he set to work desperately with Colbert and Lyonne. But
      even while he worked Louis went from the table to the window, inasmuch as
      the window looked out upon Madame's pavilion: he could see M. Fouquet in
      the courtyard, to whom the courtiers, since the favor shown towards him on
      the previous evening, paid greater attention than ever. The king,
      instinctively, on noticing Fouquet, turned towards Colbert, who was
      smiling, and seemed full of benevolence and delight, a state of feeling
      which had arisen from the very moment one of his secretaries had entered
      and handed him a pocket-book, which he had put unopened into his pocket.
      But, as there was always something sinister at the bottom of any delight
      expressed by Colbert, Louis preferred, of the smiles of the two men, that
      of Fouquet. He beckoned to the superintendent to come up, and turning
      towards Lyonne and Colbert, he said:&mdash;"Finish this matter, place it
      on my desk, and I will read it at my leisure." And he left the room. At
      the sign the king had made to him, Fouquet had hastened up the staircase,
      while Aramis, who was with the superintendent, quietly retired among the
      group of courtiers and disappeared without having been even observed by
      the king. The king and Fouquet met at the top of the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire," said Fouquet, remarking the gracious manner in which Louis was
      about to receive him, "your majesty has overwhelmed me with kindness
      during the last few days. It is not a youthful monarch, but a being of
      higher order, who reigns over France, one whom pleasure, happiness, and
      love acknowledge as their master." The king colored. The compliment,
      although flattering, was not the less somewhat pointed. Louis conducted
      Fouquet to a small room that divided his study from his
      sleeping-apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know why I summoned you?" said the king as he seated himself upon
      the edge of the window, so as not to lose anything that might be passing
      in the gardens which fronted the opposite entrance to Madame's pavilion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sire," replied Fouquet, "but I am sure for something agreeable, if I
      am to judge from your majesty's gracious smile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are mistaken, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I, sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For I summoned you, on the contrary, to pick a quarrel with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With me, sire?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes: and that a serious one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty alarms me&mdash;and yet I was most confident in your justice
      and goodness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know I am told, Monsieur Fouquet, that you are preparing a grand
      <i>fete</i> at Vaux."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet smiled, as a sick man would do at the first shiver of a fever
      which has left him but returns again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that you have not invited me!" continued the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire," replied Fouquet, "I have not even thought of the <i>fete</i> you
      speak of, and it was only yesterday evening that one of my <i>friends</i>,"
      Fouquet laid a stress upon the word, "was kind enough to make me think of
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet I saw you yesterday evening, Monsieur Fouquet, and you said nothing
      to me about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dared I hope that your majesty would so greatly descend from your own
      exalted station as to honor my dwelling with your royal presence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, Monsieur Fouquet, you did not speak to me about your <i>fete</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not allude to the <i>fete</i> to your majesty, I repeat, in the
      first place, because nothing had been decided with regard to it, and,
      secondly, because I feared a refusal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And something made you fear a refusal, Monsieur Fouquet? You see I am
      determined to push you hard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The profound wish I had that your majesty should accept my invitation&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Monsieur Fouquet, nothing is easier, I perceive, than our coming to
      an understanding. Your wish is to invite me to your <i>fete</i>, my own is
      to be present at it; invite me and I will go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible that your majesty will deign to accept?" murmured the
      superintendent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, really, monsieur," said the king, laughing, "I think I do more than
      accept; I rather fancy I am inviting myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your majesty overwhelms me with honor and delight," exclaimed Fouquet,
      "but I shall be obliged to repeat what M. Vieuville said to your ancestor,
      Henry IV., <i>Domine non sum dignus</i>." <a href="#linknote-11"
      name="linknoteref-11" id="linknoteref-11"><small>11</small></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      "To which I reply, Monsieur Fouquet, that if you give a <i>fete</i>, I
      will go, whether I am invited or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank your majesty deeply," said Fouquet, as he raised his head beneath
      this favor, which he was convinced would be his ruin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how could your majesty have been informed of it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By a public rumor, Monsieur Fouquet, which says such wonderful things of
      yourself and the marvels of your house. Would you become proud, Monsieur
      Fouquet, if the king were to be jealous of you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be the happiest man in the world, sire, since the very day on
      which your majesty were to be jealous of Vaux, I should possess something
      worthy of being offered to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, Monsieur Fouquet, prepare your <i>fete</i>, and open the door
      of your house as wide as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is for your majesty to fix the day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This day month, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has your majesty any further commands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, Monsieur Fouquet, except from the present moment until then to
      have you near me as much as possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have the honor to form one of your majesty's party for the promenade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good; indeed, I am now setting out; for there are the ladies, I see,
      who are going to start."
    </p>
    <p>
      With this remark, the king, with all the eagerness, not only of a young
      man, but of a young man in love, withdrew from the window, in order to
      take his gloves and cane, which his valet held ready for him. The neighing
      of the horses and the crunching of the wheels on the gravel of the
      courtyard could be distinctly heard. The king descended the stairs, and at
      the moment he appeared upon the flight of steps, every one stopped. The
      king walked straight up to the young queen. The queen-mother, who was
      still suffering more than ever from the illness with which she was
      afflicted, did not wish to go out. Maria Theresa accompanied Madame in her
      carriage, and asked the king in what direction he wished the promenade to
      drive. The king, who had just seen La Valliere, still pale from the event
      of the previous evening, get into a carriage with three of her companions,
      told the queen that he had no preference, and wherever she would like to
      go, there would he be with her. The queen then desired that the outriders
      should proceed in the direction of Apremont. The outriders set off
      accordingly before the others. The king rode on horseback, and for a few
      minutes accompanied the carriage of the queen and Madame. The weather had
      cleared up a little, but a kind of veil of dust, like a thick gauze, was
      still spread over the surface of the heavens, and the sun made every atom
      glisten within the circuit of its rays. The heat was stifling; but, as the
      king did not seem to pay any attention to the appearance of the heavens,
      no one made himself uneasy about it, and the promenade, in obedience to
      the orders given by the queen, took its course in the direction of
      Apremont. The courtiers who followed were in the very highest spirits; it
      was evident that every one tried to forget, and to make others forget, the
      bitter discussions of the previous evening. Madame, particularly, was
      delightful. In fact, seeing the king at the door of her carriage, as she
      did not suppose he would be there for the queen's sake, she hoped that her
      prince had returned to her. Hardly, however, had they proceeded a quarter
      of a mile on the road, when the king, with a gracious smile, saluted them
      and drew up his horse, leaving the queen's carriage to pass on, then that
      of the principal ladies of honor, and then all the others in succession,
      who, seeing the king stop, wished in their turn to stop too; but the king
      made a sign to them to continue their progress. When La Valliere's
      carriage passed, the king approached it, saluted the ladies who were
      inside, and was preparing to accompany the carriage containing the maids
      of honor, in the same way he had followed that in which Madame was, when
      suddenly the whole file of carriages stopped. It was probable that Madame,
      uneasy at the king having left her, had just given directions for the
      performance of this maneuver, the direction in which the promenade was to
      take place having been left to her. The king, having sent to inquire what
      her object was in stopping the cavalcade, was informed in reply, that she
      wished to walk. She most likely hoped that the king, who was following the
      carriages of the maids of honor on horseback, would not venture to follow
      the maids of honor themselves on foot. They had arrived in the middle of
      the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The promenade, in fact, was not ill-timed, especially for those who were
      dreamers or lovers. From the little open space where the halt had taken
      place, three beautiful long walks, shady and undulating, stretched out
      before them. These walks were covered with moss or with leaves that formed
      a carpet from the loom of nature; and each walk had its horizon in the
      distance, consisting of about a hand-breadth of sky, apparent through the
      interlacing of the branches of the trees. At the end of almost every walk,
      evidently in great tribulation and uneasiness, the startled deer were seen
      hurrying to and fro, first stopping for a moment in the middle of the
      path, and then raising their heads they fled with the speed of an arrow or
      bounded into the depths of the forest, where they disappeared from view;
      now and then a rabbit, of philosophical mien, might be noticed quietly
      sitting upright, rubbing his muzzle with his fore paws, and looking about
      inquiringly, as though wondering whether all these people, who were
      approaching in his direction, and who had just disturbed him in his
      meditations and his meal, were not followed by their dogs, or had not
      their guns under their arms. All alighted from their carriages as soon as
      they observed that the queen was doing so. Maria Theresa took the arm of
      one of her ladies of honor, and, with a side glance towards the king, who
      did not perceive that he was in the slightest degree the object of the
      queen's attention, entered the forest by the first path before her. Two of
      the outriders preceded her majesty with long poles, which they used for
      the purpose of putting the branches of the trees aside, or removing the
      bushes that might impede her progress. As soon as Madame alighted, she
      found the Comte de Guiche at her side, who bowed and placed himself at her
      disposal. Monsieur, delighted with his bath of the two previous days, had
      announced his preference for the river, and, having given De Guiche leave
      of absence, remained at the chateau with the Chevalier de Lorraine and
      Manicamp. He was not in the slightest degree jealous. He had been looked
      for to no purpose among those present; but as Monsieur was a man who
      thought a great deal of himself, and usually added very little to the
      general pleasure, his absence was rather a subject of satisfaction than
      regret. Every one had followed the example which the queen and Madame had
      set, doing just as they pleased, according as chance or fancy influenced
      them. The king, we have already observed, remained near La Valliere, and,
      throwing himself off his horse at the moment the door of her carriage was
      opened, he offered her his hand to alight. Montalais and Tonnay-Charente
      immediately drew back and kept at a distance; the former from calculated,
      the latter from natural motives. There was this difference, however,
      between the two, that the one had withdrawn from a wish to please the
      king, the other for a very opposite reason. During the last half-hour the
      weather also had undergone a change; the veil which had been spread over
      the sky, as if driven by a blast of heated air, had become massed together
      in the western part of the heavens; and afterwards, as if driven by a
      current of air from the opposite direction, was now advancing slowly and
      heavily towards them. The approach of the storm could be felt, but as the
      king did not perceive it, no one thought it proper to do so. The promenade
      was therefore continued; some of the company, with minds ill at ease on
      the subject, raised their eyes from time to time towards the sky; others,
      even more timid still, walked about without wandering too far from the
      carriages, where they relied upon taking shelter in case the storm burst.
      The greater number of these, however, observing that the king fearlessly
      entered the wood with La Valliere, followed his majesty. The king,
      noticing this, took La Valliere's hand, and led her to a lateral
      forest-alley; where no one this time ventured to follow him.

    <h2>
      Chapter LXII. The Shower of Rain.
    </h2>
    <p>
      At this moment, and in the same direction, too, that the king and La
      Valliere had taken, except that they were in the wood itself instead of
      following the path, two men were walking together, utterly indifferent to
      the appearance of the heavens. Their heads were bent down in the manner of
      people occupied with matters of great moment. They had not observed either
      De Guiche or Madame, the king or La Valliere. Suddenly something fell
      through the air like a colossal sheet of flame, followed by a loud but
      distant rumbling noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said one of them, raising his head, "here comes the storm. Let us
      reach our carriages, my dear D'Herblay."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis looked inquiringly at the heavens. "There is no occasion to hurry
      yet," he said; and then resuming the conversation where it had doubtless
      been interrupted, he said, "You were observing that the letter we wrote
      last evening must by this time have reached its destination?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was saying that she certainly has it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom did you send it by?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my own servant, as I have already told you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did he bring back an answer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not seen him since; the young girl was probably in attendance on
      Madame, or was in her own room dressing, and he may have had to wait. Our
      time for leaving arrived, and we set off, of course; I cannot, therefore,
      know what is going on yonder."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you see the king before leaving?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did he seem?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing could have passed off better, or worse; according as he be
      sincere or hypocritical."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the <i>fete?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will take place in a month."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He invited himself, you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With a pertinacity in which I detected Colbert's influence. But has not
      last night removed your illusions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What illusions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With respect to the assistance you may be able to give me under these
      circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; I have passed the night writing, and all my orders are given."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not conceal it from yourself, D'Herblay, but the <i>fete</i> will cost
      some millions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will supply six; do you on your side get two or three."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a wonderful man, my dear D'Herblay."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," inquired Fouquet, with some remaining uneasiness, "how is it that
      while you are now squandering millions in this manner, a few days ago you
      did not pay the fifty thousand francs to Baisemeaux out of your own
      pocket?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because a few days ago I was as poor as Job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-day I am wealthier than the king himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said Fouquet; "I understand men pretty well; I know you are
      incapable of forfeiting your word; I do not wish to wrest your secret from
      you, and so let us talk no more about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a dull, heavy rumbling was heard, which suddenly developed
      into a violent clap of thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, oh!" said Fouquet, "I was quite right in what I said."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come," said Aramis, "let us rejoin the carriages."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall not have time," said Fouquet, "for here comes the rain."
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, as he spoke, and as if the heavens were opened, a shower of large
      drops of rain was suddenly heard pattering on the leaves about them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall have time," said Aramis, "to reach the carriages before the
      foliage becomes saturated."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be better," said Fouquet, "to take shelter somewhere&mdash;in a
      grotto, for instance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but where are we to find a grotto?" inquired Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know one," said Fouquet, smiling, "not ten paces from here." Then
      looking round him, he added: "Yes, we are quite right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very fortunate to have so good a memory," said Aramis, smiling in
      his turn, "but are you not afraid that your coachman, finding we do not
      return, will suppose we have taken another road back, and that he will not
      follow the carriages belonging to the court?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, there is no fear of that," said Fouquet; "whenever I place my
      coachman and my carriage in any particular spot, nothing but an express
      order from the king could stir them; and more than that, too, it seems
      that we are not the only ones who have come so far, for I hear footsteps
      and the sound of voices."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Fouquet turned round, and opened with his cane a mass of
      foliage which hid the path from his view. Aramis's glance as well as his
      own plunged at the same moment through the aperture he had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A woman," said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a man," said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is La Valliere and the king," they both exclaimed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, oh!" said Aramis, "is his majesty aware of your cavern as well? I
      should not be astonished if he were, for he seems to be on very good terms
      with the dryads of Fontainebleau."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind," said Fouquet; "let us get there. If he is not aware of it,
      we shall see what he will do if he should know it, as it has two
      entrances, so that whilst he enters by one, we can leave by the other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it far?" asked Aramis, "for the rain is beginning to penetrate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are there now," said Fouquet, as he pushed aside a few branches, and
      an excavation in the solid rock could be observed, hitherto concealed by
      heaths, ivy, and a thick covert of small shrubs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet led the way, followed by Aramis; but as the latter entered the
      grotto, he turned round, saying: "Yes, they are entering the wood; and,
      see, they are bending their steps this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; let us make room for them," said Fouquet, smiling and pulling
      Aramis by his cloak; "but I do not think the king knows of my grotto."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said Aramis, "they are looking about them, but it is only for a
      thicker tree."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis was not mistaken, the king's looks were directed upward, and not
      around him. He held La Valliere's arm within his own, and held her hand in
      his. La Valliere's feet began to sleep on the damp grass. Louis again
      looked round him with greater attention than before, and perceiving an
      enormous oak with wide-spreading branches, he hurriedly drew La Valliere
      beneath its protecting shelter. The poor girl looked round her on all
      sides, and seemed half afraid, half desirous of being followed. The king
      made her lean back against the trunk of the tree, whose vast
      circumference, protected by the thickness of the foliage, was as dry as if
      at that moment the rain had not been falling in torrents. He himself
      remained standing before her with his head uncovered. After a few minutes,
      however, some drops of rain penetrated through the branches of the tree
      and fell on the king's forehead, who did not pay any attention to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sire!" murmured La Valliere, pushing the king's hat towards him. But
      the king simply bowed, and determinedly refused to cover his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now or never is the time to offer your place," said Fouquet in Aramis's
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now or never is the time to listen, and not lose a syllable of what they
      may have to say to each other," replied Aramis in Fouquet's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact they both remained perfectly silent, and the king's voice reached
      them where they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe me," said the king, "I perceive, or rather I can imagine your
      uneasiness; believe me, I sincerely regret having isolated you from the
      rest of the company, and brought you, also, to a spot where you will be
      inconvenienced by the rain. You are wet already, and perhaps cold too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And yet you tremble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid, sire, that my absence may be misinterpreted; at a moment,
      too, when all the others are reunited."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would not hesitate to propose returning to the carriages, Mademoiselle
      de la Valliere, but pray look and listen, and tell me if it be possible to
      attempt to make the slightest progress at present?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact the thunder was still rolling, and the rain continued to fall in
      torrents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Besides," continued the king, "no possible interpretation can be made
      which would be to your discredit. Are you not with the king of France; in
      other words, with the first gentleman of the kingdom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, sire," replied La Valliere, "and it is a very distinguished
      honor for me; it is not, therefore, for myself that I fear any
      interpretations that may be made."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For whom, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For you, sire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For <i>me?</i>" said the king, smiling, "I do not understand you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has your majesty already forgotten what took place yesterday evening in
      her royal highness's apartments?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! forget that, I beg, or allow me to remember it for no other purpose
      than to thank you once more for your letter, and&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire," interrupted La Valliere, "the rain is falling, and your majesty's
      head is uncovered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I entreat you not to think of anything but yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I," said La Valliere, smiling, "I am a country girl, accustomed to
      roaming through the meadows of the Loire and the gardens of Blois,
      whatever the weather may be. And, as for my clothes," she added, looking
      at her simple muslin dress, "your majesty sees there is but little room
      for injury."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, I have already noticed, more than once, that you owed nearly
      everything to yourself and nothing to your toilette. Your freedom from
      coquetry is one of your greatest charms in my eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, do not make me out better than I am, and say merely, 'You cannot
      possibly be a coquette.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because," said La Valliere, smiling, "I am not rich."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You admit, then," said the king, quickly, "that you have a love for
      beautiful things?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, I only regard those things as beautiful which are within my reach.
      Everything which is too highly placed for me&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are indifferent to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is foreign to me, as being prohibited."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I," said the king, "do not find that you are at my court on the
      footing you should be. The services of your family have not been
      sufficiently brought under my notice. The advancement of your family was
      cruelly neglected by my uncle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, sire. His royal highness, the Duke of Orleans, was
      always exceedingly kind towards M. de Saint-Remy, my step-father. The
      services rendered were humble, and, properly speaking, our services have
      been adequately recognized. It is not every one who is happy enough to
      find opportunities of serving his sovereign with distinction. I have no
      doubt at all, that, if ever opportunities had been met with, my family's
      actions would have been as lofty as their loyalty was firm: but that
      happiness was never ours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, Mademoiselle de la Valliere, it belongs to kings to repair
      the want of opportunity, and most delightedly do I undertake to repair, in
      your instance, and with the least possible delay, the wrongs of fortune
      towards you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, sire," cried La Valliere, eagerly; "leave things, I beg, as they are
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible! you refuse what I ought, and what I wish to do for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All I desired has been granted me, when the honor was conferred upon me
      of forming one of Madame's household."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if you refuse for yourself, at least accept for your family."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your generous intentions, sire, bewilder me and make me apprehensive,
      for, in doing for my family what your kindness urges you to do, your
      majesty will raise up enemies for us, and enemies for yourself, too. Leave
      me in the ranks of middle life, sire; of all the feelings and sentiments I
      experience, leave me to enjoy the pleasing instinct of disinterestedness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sentiments you express," said the king, "are indeed admirable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite true," murmured Aramis in Fouquet's ear, "and he cannot be
      accustomed to them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," replied Fouquet, "suppose she were to make a similar reply to my
      letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True!" said Aramis, "let us not anticipate, but wait the conclusion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then, dear Monsieur d'Herblay," added the superintendent, hardly able
      to appreciate the sentiments which La Valliere had just expressed, "it is
      very often sound calculation to seem disinterested with monarchs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly what I was thinking this very minute," said Aramis. "Let us
      listen."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king approached nearer to La Valliere, and as the rain dripped more
      and more through the foliage of the oak, he held his hat over the head of
      the young girl, who raised her beautiful blue eyes towards the royal hat
      which sheltered her, and shook her head, sighing deeply as she did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What melancholy thought," said the king, "can possibly reach your heart
      when I place mine as a rampart before it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you, sire. I had already once before broached this question,
      which is so difficult for a young girl of my age to discuss, but your
      majesty imposed silence on me. Your majesty belongs not to yourself alone:
      you are married; and every sentiment which would separate your majesty
      from the queen, in leading you to take notice of me, will be a source of
      profoundest sorrow for the queen." The king endeavored to interrupt the
      young girl, but she continued with a suppliant gesture. "The Queen Maria,
      with an attachment which can be well understood, follows with her eyes
      every step of your majesty which separates you from her. Happy enough in
      having had her fate united to your own, she weepingly implores Heaven to
      preserve you to her, and is jealous of the faintest throb of your heart
      bestowed elsewhere." The king again seemed anxious to speak, but again did
      La Valliere venture to prevent him.&mdash;"Would it not, therefore, be a
      most blamable action," she continued, "if your majesty, a witness of this
      anxious and disinterested affection, gave the queen any cause for
      jealousy? Forgive me, sire, for the expressions I have used. I well know
      it is impossible, or rather that it would be impossible, that the greatest
      queen of the whole world could be jealous of a poor girl like myself. But
      though a queen, she is still a woman, and her heart, like that of the rest
      of her sex, cannot close itself against the suspicions which such as are
      evilly disposed, insinuate. For Heaven's sake, sire, think no more of me;
      I am unworthy of your regard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you not know that in speaking as you have done, you change my esteem
      for you into the profoundest admiration?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, you assume my words to be contrary to the truth; you suppose me to
      be better than I really am, and attach a greater merit to me than God ever
      intended should be the case. Spare me, sire; for, did I not know that your
      majesty was the most generous man in your kingdom, I should believe you
      were jesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not, I know, fear such a thing; I am quite sure of that,"
      exclaimed Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be obliged to believe it, if your majesty continues to hold such
      language towards me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am most unhappy, then," said the king, in a tone of regret which was
      not assumed; "I am the unhappiest prince in the Christian world, since I
      am powerless to induce belief in my words, in one whom I love the best in
      the wide world, and who almost breaks my heart by refusing to credit my
      regard for her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sire!" said La Valliere, gently putting the king aside, who had
      approached nearer to her, "I think the storm has passed away now, and the
      rain has ceased." At the very moment, however, as the poor girl, fleeing
      as it were from her own heart, which doubtless throbbed but too well in
      unison with the king's, uttered these words, the storm undertook to
      contradict her. A dead-white flash of lightning illumined the forest with
      a weird glare, and a peal of thunder, like a discharge of artillery, burst
      over their heads, as if the height of the oak that sheltered them had
      attracted the storm. The young girl could not repress a cry of terror. The
      king with one hand drew her towards his heart, and stretched the other
      above her head, as though to shield her from the lightning. A moment's
      silence ensued, as the group, delightful as everything young and loving is
      delightful, remained motionless, while Fouquet and Aramis contemplated it
      in attitudes as motionless as La Valliere and the king. "Oh, sire!"
      murmured La Valliere, "do you hear?" and her head fell upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the king. "You see, the storm has not passed away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>It is a warning, sire</i>." The king smiled. "Sire, it is the voice of
      Heaven in anger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so," said the king. "I agree to accept that peal of thunder as a
      warning, and even as a menace, if, in five minutes from the present
      moment, it is renewed with equal violence; but if not, permit me to think
      that the storm is a storm simply, and nothing more." And the king, at the
      same moment, raised his head, as if to interrogate the heavens. But, as if
      the remark had been heard and accepted, during the five minutes which
      elapsed after the burst of thunder which had alarmed them, no renewed peal
      was heard; and, when the thunder was again heard, it was passing as
      plainly as if, during those same five minutes, the storm, put to flight,
      had traversed the heavens with the wings of the wind. "Well, Louise," said
      the king, in a low tone of voice, "do you still threaten me with the anger
      of Heaven? and, since you wished to regard the storm as a warning, do you
      still believe it bodes misfortune?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl looked up, and saw that while they had been talking, the
      rain had penetrated the foliage above them, and was trickling down the
      king's face. "Oh, sire, sire!" she exclaimed, in accents of eager
      apprehensions, which greatly agitated the king. "Is it for me," she
      murmured, "that the king remains thus uncovered, and exposed to the rain?
      What am I, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are, you perceive," said the king, "the divinity who dissipates the
      storm, and brings back fine weather." In fact, even as the king spoke, a
      ray of sunlight streamed through the forest, and caused the rain-drops
      which rested upon the leaves, or fell vertically among the openings in the
      branches of the trees, to glisten like diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire," said La Valliere, almost overcome, but making a powerful effort
      over herself, "think of the anxieties your majesty will have to submit to
      on my account. At this very moment, they are seeking you in every
      direction. The queen must be full of uneasiness; and Madame&mdash;oh,
      Madame!" the young girl exclaimed, with an expression almost resembling
      terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      This name had a certain effect upon the king. He started, and disengaged
      himself from La Valliere, whom he had, till that moment, held pressed
      against his heart. He then advanced towards the path, in order to look
      round, and returned, somewhat thoughtfully, to La Valliere. "Madame, did
      you say?" he remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Madame; she, too, is jealous," said La Valliere, with a marked tone
      of voice; and her eyes, so timorous in their expression, and so modestly
      fugitive in their glance, for a moment, ventured to look inquiringly into
      the king's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still," returned Louis, making an effort over himself, "it seems to me
      that Madame has no reason, no right to be jealous of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" murmured La Valliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you, too," said the king, almost in a tone of reproach, "are you
      among those who think the sister has a right to be jealous of the
      brother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not for me, sire, to seek to penetrate your majesty's secrets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You <i>do</i> believe it, then?" exclaimed the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe Madame is jealous, sire," La Valliere replied, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it possible," said the king with some anxiety, "that you have
      perceived it, then, from her conduct towards you? Have her manners in any
      way been such towards you that you can attribute them to the jealousy you
      speak of?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all, sire; I am of so little importance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! if it were really the case&mdash;" exclaimed Louis, violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire," interrupted the young girl, "it has ceased raining; some one is
      coming, I think." And, forgetful of all etiquette, she had seized the king
      by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," replied the king, "let them come. Who is there who would venture
      to think I had done wrong in remaining alone with Mademoiselle de la
      Valliere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "For pity's sake, sire! they will think it strange to see you wet through,
      in this manner, and that you should have run such risk for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have simply done my duty as a gentleman," said Louis; "and woe to him
      who may fail in his, in criticising his sovereign's conduct." In fact, at
      this moment a few eager and curious faces were seen in the walk, as if
      engaged in a search. Catching glimpses at last of the king and La
      Valliere, they seemed to have found what they were seeking. They were some
      of the courtiers who had been sent by the queen and Madame, and uncovered
      themselves, in token of having perceived his majesty. But Louis,
      notwithstanding La Valliere's confusion, did not quit his respectful and
      tender attitude. Then, when all the courtiers were assembled in the walk&mdash;when
      every one had been able to perceive the extraordinary mark of deference
      with which he had treated the young girl, by remaining standing and
      bare-headed during the storm&mdash;he offered her his arm, led her towards
      the group who were waiting, recognized by an inclination of the head the
      respectful salutations which were paid him on all sides; and, still
      holding his hat in his hand, he conducted her to her carriage. And, as a
      few sparse drops of rain continued to fall&mdash;a last adieu of the
      vanishing storm&mdash;the other ladies, whom respect had prevented from
      getting into their carriages before the king, remained altogether
      unprotected by hood or cloak, exposed to the rain from which the king was
      protecting, as well as he was able, the humblest among them. The queen and
      Madame must, like the others, have witnessed this exaggerated courtesy of
      the king. Madame was so disconcerted at it, that she touched the queen
      with her elbow, saying at the same time, "Look there, look there."
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen closed her eyes as if she had been suddenly seized with a
      fainting-spell. She lifted her hands to her face and entered her carriage,
      Madame following her. The king again mounted his horse, and without
      showing a preference for any particular carriage door, he returned to
      Fontainebleau, the reins hanging over his horse's neck, absorbed in
      thought. As soon as the crowd had disappeared, and the sound of the horses
      and carriages grew fainter in the distance, and when they were certain, in
      fact, that no one could see them, Aramis and Fouquet came out of their
      grotto, and both of them in silence passed slowly on towards the walk.
      Aramis looked most narrowly not only at the whole extent of the open space
      stretching out before and behind him, but even into the very depth of the
      wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur Fouquet," he said, when he had quite satisfied himself that they
      were alone, "we must get back, at any cost, that letter you wrote to La
      Valliere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will be easy enough," said Fouquet, "if my servant has not given it
      to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In any case it must be had, do you understand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. The king is in love with the girl, you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Deeply, and what is worse is, that on her side, the girl is passionately
      attached to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As much as to say that we must change our tactics, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a doubt of it; you have no time to lose. You must see La Valliere,
      and, without thinking any more of becoming her lover, which is out of the
      question, must declare yourself her most devoted friend and her most
      humble servant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do so," replied Fouquet, "and without the slightest feeling of
      disinclination, for she seems a good-hearted girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or a very clever one," said Aramis; "but in that case, all the greater
      reason." Then he added, after a moment's pause, "If I am not mistaken,
      that girl will become the strongest passion of the king's life. Let us
      return to our carriage, and, as fast as possible, to the chateau."

    <h2>
      Chapter LXIII. Toby.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Two hours after the superintendent's carriage had set off by Aramis's
      directions, conveying them both towards Fontainebleau with the fleetness
      of the clouds the last breath of the tempest was hurrying across the face
      of heaven, La Valliere was closeted in her own apartment, with a simple
      muslin wrapper round her, having just finished a slight repast, which was
      placed upon a marble table. Suddenly the door was opened, and a servant
      entered to announce M. Fouquet, who had called to request permission to
      pay his respects to her. She made him repeat the message twice over, for
      the poor girl only knew M. Fouquet by name, and could not conceive what
      business she could possibly have with a superintendent of finances.
      However, as he might represent the king&mdash;and, after the conversation
      we have recorded, it was very likely&mdash;she glanced at her mirror, drew
      out still more the ringlets of her hair, and desired him to be admitted.
      La Valliere could not, however, refrain from a certain feeling of
      uneasiness. A visit from the superintendent was not an ordinary event in
      the life of any woman attached to the court. Fouquet, so notorious for his
      generosity, his gallantry, and his sensitive delicacy of feeling with
      regard to women generally, had received more invitations than he had
      requested audiences. In many houses, the presence of the superintendent
      had been significant of fortune; in many hearts, of love. Fouquet entered
      the apartment with a manner full of respect, presenting himself with that
      ease and gracefulness of manner which was the distinctive characteristic
      of the men of eminence of that period, and which at the present day seems
      no longer to be understood, even through the interpretation of the
      portraits of the period, in which the painter has endeavored to recall
      them to being. La Valliere acknowledged the ceremonious salutation which
      Fouquet addressed to her by a gentle inclination of the head, and motioned
      him to a seat. But Fouquet, with a bow, said, "I will not sit down until
      you have pardoned me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?" asked La Valliere, "pardon what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet fixed a most piercing look upon the young girl, and fancied he
      could perceive in her face nothing but the most unaffected surprise. "I
      observe," he said, "that you have as much generosity as intelligence, and
      I read in your eyes the forgiveness I solicit. A pardon pronounced by your
      lips is insufficient for me, and I need the forgiveness of your heart and
      mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my honor, monsieur," said La Valliere, "I assure you most positively
      I do not understand your meaning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Again, that is a delicacy on your part which charms me," replied Fouquet,
      "and I see you do not wish me to blush before you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blush! blush before <i>me!</i> Why should you blush?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can I have deceived myself," said Fouquet; "and can I have been happy
      enough not to have offended you by my conduct towards you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, monsieur," said La Valliere, shrugging her shoulders, "you speak
      in enigmas, and I suppose I am too ignorant to understand you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it so," said Fouquet; "I will not insist. Tell me, only, I entreat
      you, that I may rely upon your full and complete forgiveness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have but one reply to make to you, monsieur," said La Valliere,
      somewhat impatiently, "and I hope that will satisfy you. If I knew the
      wrong you have done me, I would forgive you, and I now do so with still
      greater reason since I am ignorant of the wrong you allude to."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet bit his lips, as Aramis would have done. "In that case," he said,
      "I may hope, that, notwithstanding what has happened, our good
      understanding will remain undisturbed, and that you will kindly confer the
      favor upon me of believing in my respectful friendship."
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere fancied that she now began to understand, and said to herself,
      "I should not have believed M. Fouquet so eager to seek the source of a
      favor so very recent," and then added aloud, "Your friendship, monsieur!
      you offer me your friendship. The honor, on the contrary, is mine, and I
      feel overpowered by it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am aware," replied Fouquet, "that the friendship of the master may
      appear more brilliant and desirable than that of the servant; but I assure
      you the latter will be quite as devoted, quite as faithful, and altogether
      disinterested."
    </p>
    <p>
      La Valliere bowed, for, in fact, the voice of the superintendent seemed to
      convey both conviction and real devotion in its tone, and she held out her
      hand to him, saying, "I believe you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet eagerly took hold of the young girl's hand. "You see no
      difficulty, therefore," he added, "in restoring me that unhappy letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What letter?" inquired La Valliere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet interrogated her with his most searching gaze, as he had already
      done before, but the same ingenious expressions, the same transparently
      candid look met his. "I am obliged to confess," he said, after this
      denial, "that your heart is the most delicate in the world, and I should
      not feel I was a man of honor and uprightness if I were to suspect
      anything from a woman so generous as yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really, Monsieur Fouquet," replied La Valliere, "it is with profound
      regret I am obliged to repeat that I absolutely understand nothing of what
      you refer to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In fact, then, upon your honor, mademoiselle, you have not received any
      letter from me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my honor, none," replied La Valliere, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, that is quite sufficient; permit me, then, to renew the
      assurance of my utmost esteem and respect," said Fouquet. Then, bowing, he
      left the room to seek Aramis, who was waiting for him in his own
      apartment, and leaving La Valliere to ask herself whether the
      superintendent had not lost his senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" inquired Aramis, who was impatiently waiting Fouquet's return,
      "are you satisfied with the favorite?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enchanted," replied Fouquet; "she is a woman full of intelligence and
      fine feeling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She did not get angry, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Far from that&mdash;she did not even seem to understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To understand what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To understand that I had written to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She must, however, have understood you sufficiently to give the letter
      back to you, for I presume she returned it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least, you satisfied yourself that she had burnt it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Monsieur d'Herblay, I have been playing at cross-purposes for
      more than an hour, and, however amusing it may be, I begin to have had
      enough of this game. So understand me thoroughly: the girl pretended not
      to understand what I was saying to her; she denied having received any
      letter; therefore, having positively denied its receipt, she was unable
      either to return or burn it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, oh!" said Aramis, with uneasiness, "what is this you tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say that she swore most positively she had not received any letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is too much. And did you not insist?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the contrary, I did insist, almost impertinently even."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she persisted in her denial?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unhesitatingly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And did she not contradict herself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, in that case, then, you have left our letter in her hands?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could I do otherwise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! it was a great mistake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the deuce would you have done in my place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One could not force her, certainly, but it is very embarrassing; such a
      letter ought not to remain in existence against us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! the young girl's disposition is generosity itself; I looked at her
      eyes, and I can read eyes well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think she can be relied upon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From my heart I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I think we are mistaken."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think that, in point of fact, as she herself told you, she did not
      receive the letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! do you suppose&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose that, from some motive, of which we know nothing, your man did
      not deliver the letter to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet rang the bell. A servant appeared. "Send Toby here," he said. A
      moment afterwards a man made his appearance, with an anxious, restless
      look, shrewd expression of the mouth, with short arms, and his back
      somewhat bent. Aramis fixed a penetrating look upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you allow me to interrogate him myself?" inquired Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so," said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis was about to say something to the lackey, when he paused. "No," he
      said; "he would see that we attach too much importance to his answer;
      therefore question him yourself; I will pretend to be writing." Aramis
      accordingly placed himself at a table, his back turned towards the old
      attendant, whose every gesture and look he watched in a looking-glass
      opposite to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, Toby," said Fouquet to the valet, who approached with a
      tolerably firm step. "How did you execute my commission?" inquired
      Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the usual way, monseigneur," replied the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how, tell me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I succeeded in penetrating as far as Mademoiselle de la Valliere's
      apartment; but she was at mass, and so I placed the note on her
      toilette-table. Is not that what you told me to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely; and is that all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely all, monseigneur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one was there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you conceal yourself as I told you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And she returned?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten minutes afterwards."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And no one could have taken the letter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one; for no one had entered the room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the outside, but from the interior?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the place where I was secreted, I could see to the very end of the
      room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now listen to me," said Fouquet, looking fixedly at the lackey; "if this
      letter did not reach its proper destination, confess it; for, if a mistake
      has been made, your head shall be the forfeit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Toby started, but immediately recovered himself. "Monseigneur," he said,
      "I placed the letter on the very place I told you: and I ask only half an
      hour to prove to you that the letter is in Mademoiselle de la Valliere's
      hand, or to bring you back the letter itself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis looked at the valet scrutinizingly. Fouquet was ready in placing
      confidence in people, and for twenty years this man had served him
      faithfully. "Go," he said; "but bring me the proof you speak of." The
      lackey quitted the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what do you think of it?" inquired Fouquet of Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think that you must, by some means or another, assure yourself of the
      truth, either that the letter has, or has not, reached La Valliere; that,
      in the first case, La Valliere must return it to you, or satisfy you by
      burning it in your presence; that, in the second, you must have the letter
      back again, even were it to cost you a million. Come, is not that your
      opinion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; but still, my dear bishop, I believe you are exaggerating the
      importance of the affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blind, how blind you are!" murmured Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "La Valliere," returned Fouquet, "whom we assume to be a schemer of the
      first ability, is simply nothing more than a coquette, who hopes that I
      shall pay my court to her, because I have already done so, and who, now
      that she has received a confirmation of the king's regard, hopes to keep
      me in leading strings with the letter. It is natural enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is not that your opinion?" said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is not a coquette," he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Allow me to tell you&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! I am well enough acquainted with women who are coquettes," said
      Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear friend!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is a long time ago since I finished my education, you mean. But women
      are the same, throughout the centuries."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True; but men change, and you at the present day are far more suspicious
      than you formerly were." And then, beginning to laugh, he added, "Come, if
      La Valliere is willing to love me only to the extent of a third, and the
      king two-thirds, do you think the condition acceptable?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Aramis rose impatiently. "La Valliere," he said, "has never loved, and
      never will love, any one but the king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events," said Fouquet, "what would you do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ask me rather what I would have done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! what would you have done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place, I should not have allowed that man to depart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Toby?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; Toby is a traitor. Nay, I am sure of it, and I would not have let
      him go until he had told me the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is still time. I will recall him, and do you question him in your
      turn."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Agreed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I assure you it is useless. He has been with me for twenty years, and
      has never made the slightest mistake, and yet," added Fouquet, laughing,
      "it would have been easy enough for him to have done so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still, call him back. This morning I fancy I saw that face, in earnest
      conversation with one of M. Colbert's men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where was that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Opposite the stables."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah! all my people are at daggers drawn with that fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw him, I tell you, and his face, which should have been unknown to me
      when he entered just now, struck me as disagreeably familiar."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did you not say something, then, while he was here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because it is only at this very minute that my memory is clear upon the
      subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really," said Fouquet, "you alarm me." And he again rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Provided that it is not already too late," said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet once more rang impatiently. The valet usually in attendance
      appeared. "Toby!" said Fouquet, "send Toby." The valet again shut the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You leave me at perfect liberty, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Entirely so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may employ all means, then, to ascertain the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Intimidation, even?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I constitute you public prosecutor in my place."
    </p>
    <p>
      They waited ten minutes longer, but uselessly, and Fouquet, thoroughly out
      of patience, again rang loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Toby!" he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur," said the valet, "they are looking for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He cannot be far distant, I have not given him any commission to
      execute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go and see, monseigneur," replied the valet, as he closed the
      door. Aramis, during the interview, walked impatiently, but without a
      syllable, up and down the cabinet. They waited a further ten minutes.
      Fouquet rang in a manner to alarm the very dead. The valet again presented
      himself, trembling in a way to induce a belief that he was the bearer of
      bad news.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur is mistaken," he said, before even Fouquet could interrogate
      him, "you must have given Toby some commission, for he has been to the
      stables and taken your lordship's swiftest horse, and saddled it himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he has gone off."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gone!" exclaimed Fouquet. "Let him be pursued, let him be captured."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay," whispered Aramis, taking him by the hand, "be calm, the evil
      is done."
    </p>
    <p>
      The valet quietly went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The evil is done, you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt; I was sure of it. And now, let us give no cause for suspicion;
      we must calculate the result of the blow, and ward it off, if possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all," said Fouquet, "the evil is not great."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think so?" said Aramis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. Surely a man is allowed to write a love-letter to a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man, certainly; a subject, no; especially, too, when the woman in
      question is one with whom the king is in love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the king was not in love with La Valliere a week ago! he was not in
      love with her yesterday, and the letter is dated yesterday; I could not
      guess the king was in love, when the king's affection was not even yet in
      existence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you please," replied Aramis; "but unfortunately the letter is not
      dated, and it is that circumstance particularly which annoys me. If it had
      only been dated yesterday, I should not have the slightest shadow of
      uneasiness on your account."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fouquet shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I not my own master," he said, "and is the king, then, king of my
      brain and of my flesh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are right," replied Aramis, "do not let us attach greater importance
      to matters than is necessary; and besides... Well! if we are menaced, we
      have means of defense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! menaced!" said Fouquet, "you do not place this gnat bite, as it were,
      among the number of menaces which may compromise my fortune and my life,
      do you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not forget, Monsieur Fouquet, that the bit of an insect can kill a
      giant, if the insect be venomous."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But has this sovereign power you were speaking of, already vanished?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am all-powerful, it is true, but I am not immortal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, then, the most pressing matter is to find Toby again, I suppose. Is
      not that your opinion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! as for that, you will not find him again," said Aramis, "and if he
      were of any great value to you, you must give him up for lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events he is somewhere or another in the world," said Fouquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're right, let me act," replied Aramis.

    <h2>
      Chapter LXIV. Madame's Four Chances.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Anne of Austria had begged the young queen to pay her a visit. For some
      time past suffering most acutely, and losing both her youth and beauty
      with that rapidity which signalizes the decline of women for whom life has
      been one long contest, Anne of Austria had, in addition to her physical
      sufferings, to experience the bitterness of being no longer held in any
      esteem, except as a surviving remembrance of the past, amidst the youthful
      beauties, wits, and influential forces of her court. Her physician's
      opinions, her mirror also, grieved her far less than the inexorable
      warnings which the society of the courtiers afforded, who, like rats in a
      ship, abandon the hold into which on the very next voyage the water will
      infallibly penetrate, owing to the ravages of decay. Anne of Austria did
      not feel satisfied with the time her eldest son devoted to her. The king,
      a good son, more from affectation than from affection, had at first been
      in the habit of passing an hour in the morning and one in the evening with
      his mother; but, since he had himself undertaken the conduct of state
      affairs, the duration of the morning and evening's visit had been reduced
      by one half; and then, by degrees, the morning visit had been suppressed
      altogether. They met at mass; the evening visit was replaced by a meeting,
      either at the king's assembly or at Madame's, which the queen attended
      obligingly enough, out of regard to her two sons.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of this was, that Madame gradually acquired an immense
      influence over the court, which made her apartments the true royal place
      of meeting. This, Anne of Austria perceived; knowing herself to be very
      ill, and condemned by her sufferings to frequent retirement, she was
      distressed at the idea that the greater part of her future days and
      evenings would pass away solitary, useless, and in despondency. She
      recalled with terror the isolation in which Cardinal Richelieu had
      formerly left her, those dreaded and insupportable evenings, during which,
      however, she had both youth and beauty, which are ever accompanied by
      hope, to console her. She next formed the project of transporting the
      court to her own apartments, and of attracting Madame, with her brilliant
      escort, to her gloomy and already sorrowful abode, where the widow of a
      king of France, and the mother of a king of France, was reduced to
      console, in her artificial widowhood, the weeping wife of a king of
      France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne began to reflect. She had intrigued a good deal in her life. In the
      good times past, when her youthful mind nursed projects that were,
      ultimately, invariably successful, she had by her side, to stimulate her
      ambition and her love, a friend of her own sex, more eager, more ambitious
      than herself,&mdash;a friend who had loved her, a rare circumstance at
      courts, and whom some petty considerations had removed from her forever.
      But for many years past&mdash;except Madame de Motteville, and La Molena,
      her Spanish nurse, a confidante in her character of countrywoman and woman
      too&mdash;who could boast of having given good advice to the queen? Who,
      too, among all the youthful heads there, could recall the past for her,&mdash;that
      past in which alone she lived? Anne of Austria remembered Madame de
      Chevreuse, in the first place exiled rather by her wish than the king's,
      and then dying in exile, the wife of a gentleman of obscure birth and
      position. She asked herself what Madame de Chevreuse would have advised
      her to do in similar circumstances, in their mutual difficulties arising
      from their intrigues; and after serious reflection, it seemed as if the
      clever, subtle mind of her friend, full of experience and sound judgment,
      answered her in the well-remembered ironical tones: "All the insignificant
      young people are poor and greedy of gain. They require gold and incomes to
      supply means of amusement; it is by interest you must gain them over." And
      Anne of Austria adopted this plan. Her purse was well filled, and she had
      at her disposal a considerable sum of money, which had been amassed by
      Mazarin for her, and lodged in a place of safety. She possessed the most
      magnificent jewels in France, and especially pearls of a size so large
      that they made the king sigh every time he saw them, because the pearls of
      his crown were like millet seed compared to them. Anne of Austria had
      neither beauty nor charms any longer at her disposal. She gave out,
      therefore, that her wealth was great, and as an inducement for others to
      visit her apartments she let it be known that there were good gold crowns
      to be won at play, or that handsome presents were likely to be made on
      days when all went well with her; or windfalls, in the shape of annuities
      which she had wrung from the king by entreaty, and thus she determined to
      maintain her credit. In the first place, she tried these means upon
      Madame; because to gain her consent was of more importance than anything
      else. Madame, notwithstanding the bold confidence which her wit and beauty
      inspired her, blindly ran head foremost into the net thus stretched out to
      catch her. Enriched by degrees by these presents and transfers of
      property, she took a fancy to inheritances by anticipation. Anne of
      Austria adopted the same means towards Monsieur, and even towards the king
      himself. She instituted lotteries in her apartments. The day on which the
      present chapter opens, invitations had been issued for a late supper in
      the queen-mother's apartments, as she intended that two beautiful diamond
      bracelets of exquisite workmanship should be put into a lottery. The
      medallions were antique cameos of the greatest value; the diamonds, in
      point of intrinsic value, did not represent a very considerable amount,
      but the originality and rarity of the workmanship were such, that every
      one at court not only wished to possess the bracelets, but even to see the
      queen herself wear them; for, on the days she wore them, it was considered
      as a favor to be admitted to admire them in kissing her hands. The
      courtiers had, even with regard to this subject, adopted various
      expressions of gallantry to establish the aphorism, that the bracelets
      would have been priceless in value if they had not been unfortunate enough
      to be placed in contact with arms as beautiful as the queen's. This
      compliment had been honored by a translation into all the languages of
      Europe, and numerous verses in Latin and French had been circulated on the
      subject. The day that Anne of Austria had selected for the lottery was a
      decisive moment; the king had not been near his mother for a couple of
      days; Madame, after the great scene of the Dryads and Naiads, was sulking
      by herself. It is true, the king's fit of resentment was over, but his
      mind was absorbingly occupied by a circumstance that raised him above the
      stormy disputes and giddy pleasures of the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Austria effected a diversion by the announcement of the famous
      lottery to take place in her apartments on the following evening. With
      this object in view, she saw the young queen, whom, as we have already
      seen, she had invited to pay her a visit in the morning. "I have good news
      to tell you," she said to her; "the king has been saying the most tender
      things about you. He is young, you know, and easily drawn away; but so
      long as you keep near me, he will not venture to keep away from you, to
      whom, besides, he is most warmly and affectionately attached. I intend to
      have a lottery this evening and shall expect to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have heard," said the young queen, with a sort of timid reproach, "that
      your majesty intends to put in the lottery those lovely bracelets whose
      rarity is so great that we ought not to allow them to pass out of the
      custody of the crown, even were there no other reason than that they had
      once belonged to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My daughter," said Anne of Austria, who read the young queen's thoughts,
      and wished to console her for not having received the bracelets as a
      present, "it is positively necessary that I should induce Madame to pass
      her time in my apartments."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame!" said the young queen, blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course: would you not prefer to have a rival near you, whom you could
      watch and influence, to knowing the king is with her, always as ready to
      flirt as to be flirted with by her? The lottery I have proposed is my
      means of attraction for that purpose; do you blame me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no!" returned Maria Theresa, clapping her hands with a childlike
      expression of delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you no longer regret, then, that I did not give you these bracelets,
      as I at first intended to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; make yourself look as beautiful as possible that our supper
      may be very brilliant; the gayer you seem, the more charming you appear,
      and you will eclipse all the ladies present as much by your brilliancy as
      by your rank."
    </p>
    <p>
      Maria Theresa left full of delight. An hour afterwards, Anne of Austria
      received a visit from Madame, whom she covered with caresses, saying,
      "Excellent news! the king is charmed with my lottery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I," replied Madame, "am not so greatly charmed: to see such beautiful
      bracelets on any one's arms but yours or mine, is what I cannot reconcile
      myself to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," said Anne of Austria, concealing by a smile a violent pang
      she had just experienced, "do not look at things in the worst light
      immediately."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Madame, Fortune is blind, and I am told there are two hundred
      tickets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite as many as that; but you cannot surely forget that there can only
      be one winner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No doubt. But who will that be? Can you tell?" said Madame, in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You remind me that I had a dream last night; my dreams are always good,&mdash;I
      sleep so little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was your dream?&mdash;but are you suffering?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the queen, stifling with wonderful command the torture of a
      renewed attack of shooting pains in her bosom; "I dreamed that the king
      won the bracelets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are going to ask me, I think, what the king could possibly do with
      the bracelets?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you would not add, perhaps, that it would be very fortunate if the
      king were really to win, for he would be obliged to give the bracelets to
      some one else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To restore them to you, for instance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In which case I should immediately give them away; for you do not think,
      I suppose," said the queen, laughing, "that I have put these bracelets up
      to a lottery from necessity. My object was to give them without arousing
      any one's jealousy; but if Fortune will not get me out of my difficulty&mdash;well,
      I will teach Fortune a lesson&mdash;and I know very well to whom I intend
      to offer the bracelets." These words were accompanied by so expressive a
      smile, that Madame could not resist paying her by a grateful kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," added Anne of Austria, "do you not know, as well as I do, that if
      the king were to win the bracelets, he would not restore them to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean he would give them to the queen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; and for the very same reason that he would not give them back again
      to me; since, if I had wished to make the queen a present of them, I had
      no need of him for that purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame cast a side glance upon the bracelets, which, in their casket, were
      dazzlingly exposed to view upon a table close beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How beautiful they are," she said, sighing. "But stay," Madame continued,
      "we are quite forgetting that your majesty's dream was nothing but a
      dream."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be very much surprised," returned Anne of Austria, "if my dream
      were to deceive me; that has happened to me very seldom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We may look upon you as a prophetess, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have already said, that I dream but very rarely; but the coincidence of
      my dream about this matter, with my own ideas, is extraordinary! it agrees
      so wonderfully with my own views and arrangements."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What arrangements do you allude to?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you will get the bracelets, for instance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, it will not be the king."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Anne of Austria, "there is not such a very great distance
      between his majesty's heart and your own; for, are you not his sister, for
      whom he has a great regard? There is not, I repeat, so very wide a
      distance, that my dream can be pronounced false on that account. Come, let
      us reckon up the chances in its favor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will count them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the first place, we will begin with the dream. If the king wins, he is
      sure to give you the bracelets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I admit that is one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you win them, they are yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Naturally; that may be admitted also."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lastly;&mdash;if Monsieur were to win them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" said Madame, laughing heartily, "he would give them to the Chevalier
      de Lorraine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Austria laughed as heartily as her daughter-in-law; so much so,
      indeed, that her sufferings again returned, and made her turn suddenly
      pale in the very midst of her enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter?" inquired Madame, terrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, nothing; a pain in my side. I have been laughing too much. We
      were at the fourth chance, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot see a fourth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg your pardon; I am not excluded from the chance of winning, and if I
      be the winner, you are sure of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! thank you, thank you!" exclaimed Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope that you look upon yourself as one whose chances are good, and
      that my dream now begins to assure the solid outlines of reality."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, indeed: you give me both hope and confidence," said Madame, "and the
      bracelets, won in this manner, will be a hundred times more precious to
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! then, good-bye, until this evening." And the two princesses
      separated. Anne of Austria, after her daughter-in-law had left her, said
      to herself, as she examined the bracelets, "They are, indeed, precious;
      since, by their means, this evening, I shall have won over a heart to my
      side, at the same time, fathomed an important secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then turning towards the deserted recess in her room, she said, addressing
      vacancy,&mdash;"Is it not thus that you would have acted, my poor
      Chevreuse? Yes, yes; I know it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      And, like a perfume of other, fairer days, her youth, her imagination, and
      her happiness seemed to be wafted towards the echo of this invocation.

    <h2>
      Chapter LXV. The Lottery.
    </h2>
    <p>
      By eight o'clock in the evening, every one had assembled in the
      queen-mother's apartments. Anne of Austria, in full dress, beautiful
      still, from former loveliness, and from all the resources coquetry can
      command at the hands of clever assistants, concealed, or rather pretended
      to conceal, from the crowd of courtiers who surrounded her, and who still
      admired her, thanks to the combination of circumstances which we have
      indicated in the preceding chapter, the ravages, which were already
      visible, of the acute suffering to which she finally yielded a few years
      later. Madame, almost as great a coquette as Anne of Austria, and the
      queen, simple and natural as usual, were seated beside her, each
      contending for her good graces. The ladies of honor, united in a body, in
      order to resist with greater effect, and consequently with more success,
      the witty and lively conversations which the young men held about them,
      were enabled, like a battalion formed in a square, to offer each other the
      means of attack and defense which were thus at their command. Montalais,
      learned in that species of warfare which consists of sustained
      skirmishing, protected the whole line by a sort of rolling fire she
      directed against the enemy. Saint-Aignan, in utter despair at the rigor,
      which became almost insulting from the very fact of her persisting in it,
      Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente displayed, tried to turn his back upon
      her; but, overcome by the irresistible brilliancy of her eyes, he, every
      moment, returned to consecrate his defeat by new submissions, to which
      Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente did not fail to reply by fresh acts of
      impertinence. Saint-Aignan did not know which way to turn. La Valliere had
      about her, not exactly a court, but sprinklings of courtiers.
      Saint-Aignan, hoping by this maneuver to attract Athenais's attention
      towards him, approached the young girl, and saluted her with a respect
      that induced some to believe that he wished to balance Athenais by Louise.
      But these were persons who had neither been witnesses of the scene during
      the shower, nor had heard it spoken of. As the majority was already
      informed, and well informed, too, on the matter, the acknowledged favor
      with which she was regarded had attracted to her side some of the most
      astute, as well as the least sensible, members of the court. The former,
      because they said with Montaigne, "How do I know?" and the latter, who
      said with Rabelais, "Perhaps." The greatest number had followed in the
      wake of the latter, just as in hunting five or six of the best hounds
      alone follow the scent of the animal hunted, whilst the remainder of the
      pack follow only the scent of the hounds. The two queens and Madame
      examined with particular attention the toilettes of their ladies and maids
      of honor; and they condescended to forget they were queens in recollecting
      that they were women. In other words, they pitilessly picked to pieces
      every person present who wore a petticoat. The looks of both princesses
      simultaneously fell upon La Valliere, who, as we have just said, was
      completely surrounded at that moment. Madame knew not what pity was, and
      said to the queen-mother, as she turned towards her, "If Fortune were
      just, she would favor that poor La Valliere."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not possible," said the queen-mother, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are only two hundred tickets, so that it was not possible to
      inscribe every one's name on the list."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And hers is not there, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pity! she might have won them, and then sold them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sold them!" exclaimed the queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; it would have been a dowry for her, and she would not have been
      obliged to marry without her <i>trousseau</i>, as will probably be the
      case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really," answered the queen-mother, "poor little thing: has she no
      dresses, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And she pronounced these words like a woman who has never been able to
      understand the inconveniences of a slenderly filled purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay, look at her. Heaven forgive me, if she is not wearing the very same
      petticoat this evening that she had on this morning during the promenade,
      and which she managed to keep clean, thanks to the care the king took of
      her, in sheltering her from the rain."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very moment Madame uttered these words the king entered the room.
      The two queens would not perhaps have observed his arrival, so completely
      were they occupied in their ill-natured remarks, had not Madame noticed
      that, all at once, La Valliere, who was standing up facing the gallery,
      exhibited certain signs of confusion, and then said a few words to the
      courtiers who surrounded her, who immediately dispersed. This movement
      induced Madame to look towards the door, and at that moment, the captain
      of the guards announced the king. At this moment La Valliere, who had
      hitherto kept her eyes fixed upon the gallery, suddenly cast them down as
      the king entered. His majesty was dressed magnificently and in the most
      perfect taste; he was conversing with Monsieur and the Duc de Roquelaure,
      Monsieur on his right, and the Duc de Roquelaure on his left. The king
      advanced, in the first place, towards the queens, to whom he bowed with an
      air full of graceful respect. He took his mother's hand and kissed it,
      addressed a few compliments to Madame upon the beauty of her toilette, and
      then began to make the round of the assembly. La Valliere was saluted in
      the same manner as the others, but with neither more nor less attention.
      His majesty then returned to his mother and his wife. When the courtiers
      noticed that the king had only addressed some ordinary remark to the young
      girl who had been so particularly noticed in the morning, they immediately
      drew their own conclusion to account for this coldness of manner; this
      conclusion being, that although the king may have taken a sudden fancy to
      her, that fancy had already disappeared. One thing, however, must be
      remarked, that close beside La Valliere, among the number of the
      courtiers, M. Fouquet was to be seen; and his respectfully attentive
      manner served to sustain the young girl in the midst of the varied
      emotions that visibly agitated her.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Fouquet was just on the point, moreover, of speaking in a more friendly
      manner with Mademoiselle de la Valliere, when M. Colbert approached, and
      after having bowed to Fouquet with all the formality of respectful
      politeness, he seemed to take up a post beside La Valliere, for the
      purpose of entering into conversation with her. Fouquet immediately
      quitted his place. These proceedings were eagerly devoured by the eyes of
      Montalais and Malicorne, who mutually exchanged their observations on the
      subject. De Guiche, standing within the embrasure of one of the windows,
      saw no one but Madame. But as Madame, on her side, frequently glanced at
      La Valliere, De Guiche's eyes, following Madame's, were from time to time
      cast upon the young girl. La Valliere instinctively felt herself sinking
      beneath the weight of all these different looks, inspired, some by
      interest, others by envy. She had nothing to compensate her for her
      sufferings, not a kind word from her companions, nor a look of affection
      from the king. No one could possibly express the misery the poor girl was
      suffering. The queen-mother next directed the small table to be brought
      forward, on which the lottery-tickets were placed, two hundred in number,
      and begged Madame de Motteville to read the list of the names. It was a
      matter of course that this list had been drawn out in strict accordance
      with the laws of etiquette. The king's name was first on the list, next
      the queen-mother, then the queen, Monsieur, Madame, and so on. All hearts
      throbbed anxiously as the list was read out; more than three hundred
      persons had been invited, and each of them was anxious to learn whether
      his or her name was to be found in the number of privileged names. The
      king listened with as much attention as the others, and when the last name
      had been pronounced, he noticed that La Valliere had been omitted from the
      list. Every one, of course, remarked this omission. The king flushed as if
      much annoyed; but La Valliere, gentle and resigned, as usual, exhibited
      nothing of the sort. While the list was being read, the king had not taken
      his eyes off the young girl, who seemed to expand, as it were, beneath the
      happy influence she felt was shed around her, and who was delighted and
      too pure in spirit for any other thought than that of love to find an
      entrance either to her mind or her heart. Acknowledging this touching
      self-denial by the fixity of his attention, the king showed La Valliere
      how much he appreciated its delicacy. When the list was finished, the
      different faces of those who had been omitted or forgotten fully expressed
      their disappointment. Malicorne was also left out from amongst the men;
      and the grimace he made plainly said to Montalais, who was also forgotten,
      "Cannot we contrive to arrange matters with Fortune in such a manner that
      she shall not forget us?" to which a smile full of intelligence from
      Mademoiselle Aure, replied: "Certainly we can."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tickets were distributed to each according to the number listed. The
      king received his first, next the queen-mother, then Monsieur, then the
      queen and Madame, and so on. After this, Anne of Austria opened a small
      Spanish leather bag, containing two hundred numbers engraved upon small
      balls of mother-of-pearl, and presented the open sack to the youngest of
      her maids of honor, for the purpose of taking one of the balls out of it.
      The eager expectation of the throng, amidst all the tediously slow
      preparations, was rather that of cupidity than curiosity. Saint-Aignan
      bent towards Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente to whisper to her, "Since we
      have each a number, let us unite our two chances. The bracelet shall be
      yours if I win, and if you are successful, deign to give me but one look
      of your beautiful eyes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said Athenais, "if you win the bracelet, keep it, every one for
      himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are without any pity," said Saint-Aignan, "and I will punish you by a
      quatrain:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beautiful Iris, to my vows You are too opposed&mdash;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silence," said Athenais, "you will prevent me hearing the winning
      number."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Number one," said the young girl who had drawn the mother-of-pearl from
      the Spanish leather bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king!" exclaimed the queen-mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The king has won," repeated the queen, delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! the king! your dream!" said Madame, joyously, in the ear of Anne of
      Austria.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was the only one who did not exhibit any satisfaction. He merely
      thanked Fortune for what she had done for him, in addressing a slight
      salutation to the young girl who had been chosen as her proxy. Then
      receiving from the hands of Anne of Austria, amid the eager desire of the
      whole assembly, the casket inclosing the bracelets, he said, "Are these
      bracelets really beautiful, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at them," said Anne of Austria, "and judge for yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king looked at them, and said, "Yes, indeed, an admirable medallion.
      What perfect finish!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Queen Maria Theresa easily saw, and that, too at the very first glance,
      that the king would not offer the bracelets to her; but, as he did not
      seem the least degree in the world disposed to offer them to Madame, she
      felt almost satisfied, or nearly so. The king sat down. The most intimate
      among the courtiers approached, one by one, for the purpose of admiring
      more closely the beautiful piece of workmanship, which soon, with the
      king's permission, was handed about from person to person. Immediately,
      every one, connoisseurs or not, uttered various exclamations of surprise,
      and overwhelmed the king with congratulations. There was, in fact,
      something for everybody to admire&mdash;the brilliance for some, and the
      cutting for others. The ladies present visibly displayed their impatience
      to see such a treasure monopolized by the gentlemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen, gentlemen," said the king, whom nothing escaped, "one would
      almost think that you wore bracelets as the Sabines used to do; hand them
      round for a while for the inspection of the ladies, who seem to have, and
      with far greater right, an excuse for understanding such matters!"
    </p>
    <p>
      These words appeared to Madame the commencement of a decision she
      expected. She gathered, besides, this happy belief from the glances of the
      queen-mother. The courtier who held them at the moment the king made this
      remark, amidst the general agitation, hastened to place the bracelets in
      the hands of the queen, Maria Theresa, who, knowing too well, poor woman,
      that they were not designed for her, hardly looked at them, and almost
      immediately passed them on to Madame. The latter, and even more minutely,
      Monsieur, gave the bracelets a long look of anxious and almost covetous
      desire. She then handed the jewels to those ladies who were near her,
      pronouncing this single word, but with an accent which was worth a long
      phrase, "Magnificent!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies who had received the bracelets from Madame's hands looked at
      them as long as they chose to examine them, and then made them circulate
      by passing them on towards the right. During this time the king was
      tranquilly conversing with De Guiche and Fouquet, rather passively letting
      them talk than himself listening. Accustomed to the set form of ordinary
      phrases, his ear, like that of all men who exercise an incontestable
      superiority over others, merely selected from the conversations held in
      various directions the indispensable word which requires reply. His
      attention, however, was now elsewhere, for it wandered as his eyes did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mademoiselle de Tonnay-Charente was the last of the ladies inscribed for
      tickets; and, as if she had ranked according to her name upon the list,
      she had only Montalais and La Valliere near her. When the bracelets
      reached these two latter, no one appeared to take any further notice of
      them. The humble hands which for a moment touched these jewels, deprived
      them, for the time, of their importance&mdash;a circumstance which did
      not, however, prevent Montalais from starting with joy, envy, and covetous
      desire, at the sight of the beautiful stones still more than at their
      magnificent workmanship. It is evident that if she were compelled to
      decide between the pecuniary value and the artistic beauty, Montalais
      would unhesitatingly have preferred diamonds to cameos, and her
      disinclination, therefore, to pass them on to her companion, La Valliere,
      was very great. La Valliere fixed a look almost of indifference upon the
      jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, how beautiful, how magnificent these bracelets are!" exclaimed
      Montalais; "and yet you do not go into ecstasies about them, Louise! You
      are no true woman, I am sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I am, indeed," replied the young girl, with an accent of the most
      charming melancholy; "but why desire that which can never, by any
      possibility, be ours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, his head bent forward, was listening to what Louise was saying.
      Hardly had the vibration of her voice reached his ear than he rose,
      radiant with delight, and passing across the whole assembly, from the
      place where he stood, to La Valliere, "You are mistaken, mademoiselle," he
      said, "you are a woman, and every woman has a right to wear jewels, which
      are a woman's appurtenance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sire!" said La Valliere, "your majesty will not absolutely believe in
      my modesty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe you possess every virtue, mademoiselle; frankness as well as
      every other; I entreat you, therefore, to say frankly what you think of
      these bracelets?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That they are beautiful, sire, and cannot be offered to any other than a
      queen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am delighted that such is your opinion, mademoiselle; the bracelets are
      yours, and the king begs your acceptance of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      And as, with a movement almost resembling terror, La Valliere eagerly held
      out the casket to the king, the king gently pushed back her trembling
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence of astonishment, more profound than that of death, reigned in
      the assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, from the side where the queens were, no one had heard what he had
      said, nor understood what he had done. A charitable friend, however, took
      upon herself to spread the news; it was Tonnay-Charente, to whom Madame
      had made a sign to approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good heavens!" explained Tonnay-Charente, "how happy that La Valliere is!
      the king has just given her the bracelets."
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame bit her lips to such a degree that the blood appeared upon the
      surface of the skin. The young queen looked first at La Valliere and then
      at Madame, and began to laugh. Anne of Austria rested her chin upon her
      beautiful white hand, and remained for a long time absorbed by a
      presentiment that disturbed her mind, and by a terrible pang which stung
      her heart. De Guiche, observing Madame turn pale, and guessing the cause
      of her change of color, abruptly quitted the assembly and disappeared.
      Malicorne was then able to approach Montalais very quietly, and under
      cover of the general din of conversation, said to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aure, your fortune and our future are standing at your elbow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," was her reply, as she tenderly embraced La Valliere, whom,
      inwardly, she was tempted to strangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      End of Ten Years Later. The next text in the series is Louise de la
      Valliere.

      <h3>
        TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE:
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is a multi volume file
      </p>
      <p>
        The index has links to all volumes.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two html files in each zipped html folder. The .....-h.htm
        file should be used if you wish to use a downloaded file off-line which
        will link to all the other files in the set which are still on-line. The
        .....-h2.htm file will be used only if you wish to build a complete
        off-line set of files as the links in this html file are designed only
        for off-line use. If you want to download all three volumes and have the
        links work on your own computer, then follow these directions carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Create a directory (folder) named whatever you like (e.g.,
        Maupassant). (The name of this directory (folder) is not critical, but
        the inner folders <i>must</i> be named as listed below, or the links
        between volumes will <i>not</i> work).
      </p>
      <p>
        2. In that directory (folder) create as many directories (folders) as
        there are volumes in the set and name each of new folders after the
        original filename, for example:
      </p>
      <ul class="none">
        <li>
          20023
        </li>
        <li>
          24780
        </li>
        <li>
          28649
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        3. In each of the above directories you just created, create a directory
        of the same filename but this time in the pattern:
      </p>
      <ul class="none">
        <li>
          In the 20023 directory create a directory named 20023-h
        </li>
        <li>
          In the 24780 directory create a directory named 24780-h
        </li>
        <li>
          In the 28649 directory create a directory named 28649-h
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        4. Download the <i>zipped</i> html version of each volume from the PG
        Catalog.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. Unzip the downloaded files, you will find an html directory for
        example 20023-h which contains two html files named, for example,
        20023-h.htm and 20023-h2.htm
      </p>
      <ul class="nonetn">
        <li>
          Move the unzipped 20023-h2.htm file and its "images" directory into
          your new 20023-h directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Move the unzipped 24780-h2.htm file and its "images" directory into
          your new 24780-h directory.
        </li>
        <li>
          Move the unzipped 28649-h2.htm file and its "images" directory into
          your new 28649-h directory.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr class="short" />
      <p>
        Rename each of the html files by removing the number 2 at the end of the
        filename so for each you have, for example, 20023-h2.htm changed to
        20023-h.htm

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
